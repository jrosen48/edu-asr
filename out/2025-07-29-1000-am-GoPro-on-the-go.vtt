WEBVTT

00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:02.474
Tell you're recording because then... Okay, it is.

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:03.014
Yeah, you're good.

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.078
We're running out of our eight minutes.

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:09.542
Oh, I'll just let you go, sorry.

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:10.083
Hello.

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:15.930
I want to get something different.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.230
Okay.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:19.273
So are you just tossing it?

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.137
Or do we want to include any of that?

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:24.540
Okay, so eight minutes.

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:29.245
So basically nine, or not nine, 10-08.

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:57.139
okay okay so we just write down as many do we want to do we have to identify them or just pick them i know that he said both and he was like a through e or something of the sort is five here you want to write them down okay moss i want to say this is strawberry wild strawberry um

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.722
That might be nimblewill, but this is not.

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:06.346
This is maybe a sedge.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.488
And then this is a different type of grass.

00:01:09.128 --> 00:01:10.369
This is plantain.

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.632
Do you know what this is?

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:15.874
I'm not a plant girl.

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:21.179
I'm actually astounded by all the stuff you pulled already and was able to name.

00:01:21.519 --> 00:01:22.040
Clover.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.885
This is another type of grass.

00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:30.750
They just come up.

00:01:39.402 --> 00:01:45.091
This is another type of plant.

00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:47.214
It's like a creeping plant.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:57.889
This little buddy I think is different as well.

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:20.822
we just we're not going for numbers we're just going for types yeah so it had for an example they had a through f then we can use i naturalists

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:26.812
Different types of moss.

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:29.035
This one, there's two types of moss.

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:35.222
There's this moss and then there's like this one.

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:38.786
Did you get the, this one?

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:40.689
Is it a plantain?

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.837
Self heal?

00:02:47.857 --> 00:02:48.017
Yeah.

00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:49.459
This is a plantain.

00:02:50.452 --> 00:03:02.250
Ooh, what's in that?

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.814
Oh, they count.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.056
It's gonna be a fungi.

00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:07.819
It's a fungi.

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:14.010
Okay, this is not confident.

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:17.094
We broke the system.

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:19.757
This is also different.

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:25.885
This is a different type of moss thing.

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.215
You can take from my pile and identify them too.

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:40.945
This won't focus on it.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.542
Yeah, I won't focus on it.

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:44.123
It's okay.

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:44.984
Michelle, are you guys good?

00:03:45.585 --> 00:03:46.406
Oh, we're good.

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:47.527
Okay.

00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:47.988
We're done?

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.810
Can we come back?

00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:52.554
I thought we had eight minutes.

00:03:53.815 --> 00:03:57.320
Well, you were all gonna go.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.083
Ready?

00:04:00.103 --> 00:04:02.306
Okay.

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:05.330
Artifacts, stay where you are.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.490
Okay.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.036
So when I watch you, can you guys all hear me?

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:10.236
Yes, sir.

00:04:10.256 --> 00:04:11.117
So this is what I want everybody to do now.

00:04:11.485 --> 00:04:18.033
I want you to look at your artifacts, and I want you to make observations on each one.

00:04:18.053 --> 00:04:20.136
Don't bother giving it a name yet, right?

00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:20.837
I don't like the look of it.

00:04:20.857 --> 00:04:24.822
I'm just trying to describe and discern the difference between the samples we collected.

00:04:24.842 --> 00:04:28.607
Write a little heat description for each, okay?

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:33.754
And if you want, you can name it.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:37.318
But that will change as we get a group consensus after this.

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:38.420
Okay, group consensus.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.620
Oh, wait.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.362
You guys got a map to set on?

00:04:40.932 --> 00:04:43.395
Yeah, that would be most appreciative, thank you.

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:51.866
Where can you write this at?

00:04:53.067 --> 00:05:00.056
I just put it in your- Ohhhh.

00:05:00.076 --> 00:05:02.258
You left it up there.

00:05:02.278 --> 00:05:02.379
Yep.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.499
Okay.

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:10.028
Okay, so the first one I've got is our fungi living on a branch.

00:05:15.256 --> 00:05:18.062
Okay.

00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:21.529
Are they a lichen or are they a fungi?

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:22.692
I think those are fungi.

00:05:27.442 --> 00:05:29.406
It wasn't working on mine, did it work on yours?

00:05:29.687 --> 00:05:32.372
There's also some crustose lichen on there.

00:05:33.114 --> 00:05:33.214
Okay.

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:36.979
He said not to identify him.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.922
That's just A. Okay.

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:40.784
We're not really focused on him, but you can if you want.

00:05:40.804 --> 00:05:42.046
I mean, you're on a high school level.

00:05:42.186 --> 00:05:43.648
If you want to be able to use names.

00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:44.148
That's better.

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.532
But as we do this, it gets kind of confusing, right?

00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:50.557
Because everyone has different samples from these spots they surveyed.

00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:54.782
So A and then B. One second.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:56.685
Let me, I'm pulling up a picture of this.

00:05:57.306 --> 00:05:57.666
Okay.

00:06:12.293 --> 00:06:15.436
Now it's on the stick.

00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:20.962
Yeah.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:23.525
What is it?

00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:25.467
It's mushrooms.

00:06:29.771 --> 00:06:30.372
Got that wrong.

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:32.174
Can I toss him back?

00:06:32.994 --> 00:06:35.577
Yeah.

00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:35.978
Okay.

00:06:36.738 --> 00:06:38.380
I'm pretty sure that was the one that was pulled in.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.942
Next one is a mock.

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:40.242
So B is

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.384
The moss, like, it's right... zominate or isome.

00:06:46.404 --> 00:06:55.493
It's a rhizome.

00:06:59.657 --> 00:07:01.438
Okay.

00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:01.779
Moss.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:08.305
Okay.

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:39.034
and a little bit when you guys are done I'm going to grab the other one in the middle okay so you can grab everything okay you want us to bring our samples yeah okay so keep the samples yeah when I'm done with them I'm going to put them in everything okay see if this is the same thing see are we just going to do a through f or are we wanting to do all of them I'm going to try to do all of them okay he's rushing me

00:07:40.988 --> 00:07:42.610
So this one's the same thing.

00:07:45.854 --> 00:07:50.179
So moving on to C, which is in the grass family.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.641
It's like one minute.

00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:52.722
Good.

00:07:52.742 --> 00:07:53.503
You guys need more than a minute.

00:07:53.543 --> 00:07:54.344
More than a minute.

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:55.085
More?

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.127
OK.

00:07:57.147 --> 00:07:59.250
How's two minutes now?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.751
I suppose I could see.

00:08:01.532 --> 00:08:04.656
How many minutes do you need?

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:04.996
Two.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:05.477
How many you got?

00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:05.938
I got tons of time.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.441
Oh.

00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:09.502
We got like 40 minutes.

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:09.662
And 40.

00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:16.455
Japanese Stiltgrass.

00:08:16.715 --> 00:08:29.572
Uh, yes.

00:08:37.201 --> 00:08:38.703
Okay.

00:08:38.723 --> 00:08:40.105
So we were perfect.

00:08:43.983 --> 00:09:05.012
what is that noise we finished and they were like

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:10.003
That's it, that's all you want me to do?

00:09:10.303 --> 00:09:11.344
And I was like, okay, maybe that wasn't good enough.

00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:13.707
So each year I've been trying to make it a little bit more complex, and I'm definitely going to try it.

00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:15.668
Beefsteak plant.

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:16.329
Like beef?

00:09:16.749 --> 00:09:18.951
Yeah, or purple mint.

00:09:18.971 --> 00:09:19.992
Chinese basil.

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:21.714
Those are all common names.

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:30.341
It's also sick because, oh, where have you put all of our little, were you putting them back?

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.744
Oh shoot, they're all right here though.

00:09:32.764 --> 00:09:33.384
Take them back.

00:09:33.624 --> 00:09:34.425
They're all right here though.

00:09:35.587 --> 00:10:01.645
hmm well you threw the one moss in there so okay then yeah we have our three samples there okay so what was beef stick again it was just beef stick something you're good oh I have okay I have all of it okay

00:10:02.536 --> 00:10:03.777
It's just different.

00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:06.120
I want to say this is another beef steak.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.201
Okay.

00:10:07.221 --> 00:10:08.082
This, wouldn't you say?

00:10:08.843 --> 00:10:09.904
We already have that, so.

00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:14.269
Yeah, it looks like it matches with the front.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.452
Almost there.

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:26.282
White Havens.

00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:27.683
A-B-E-N-S.

00:10:27.882 --> 00:10:29.624
A-V-E-N-S?

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:31.948
Yes.

00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:32.969
Okay.

00:10:35.172 --> 00:10:39.859
So that should be F?

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:39.959
Yep.

00:10:39.979 --> 00:10:46.748
Is that the same grass?

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:50.574
Somebody else though?

00:10:51.695 --> 00:10:52.316
Oh, yep.

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:53.277
He just pointed at us.

00:10:53.297 --> 00:10:55.881
Uh, Asiatic Dave?

00:10:55.861 --> 00:11:10.398
Lay them out so everyone can see them.

00:11:10.418 --> 00:11:11.580
If you guys are done.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.102
If you're not done, it's okay.

00:11:13.122 --> 00:11:16.065
Take one more minute to wrap up what you're up to.

00:11:18.007 --> 00:11:24.315
You can do both at the same time.

00:11:26.523 --> 00:11:28.365
Did we get enough?

00:11:28.385 --> 00:11:29.747
We're at G, right here.

00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:29.867
Yeah.

00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:33.831
Well, you just said aviatic days flower.

00:11:33.972 --> 00:11:38.777
Yeah, so more on G. This one's going to be a plantain probably.

00:11:42.562 --> 00:11:44.063
What do we be after G?

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:45.405
Black seed plantain.

00:11:47.487 --> 00:11:52.613
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. So you guys are probably good.

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:52.733
Yeah.

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:54.235
So black seed plantain.

00:11:54.957 --> 00:12:10.603
okay you take that pile i'll take this okay black seed champagne plantain oh like yep got you all right time has expired

00:12:13.469 --> 00:12:42.548
So as you guys bring over your samples, you'll be organizing and lumping them with their lights.

00:12:43.557 --> 00:12:45.960
I think that got them wrong.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.322
I've already laid them down.

00:12:48.502 --> 00:12:49.523
We had, she grabbed them.

00:12:49.543 --> 00:12:52.567
There's like four different things.

00:12:52.587 --> 00:12:55.990
Like grasses, like super wispy mediums.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.712
Isn't this me and others?

00:12:57.732 --> 00:12:57.992
Yeah, my bad.

00:12:58.012 --> 00:12:58.393
You're right.

00:12:58.413 --> 00:12:59.774
Well, and then there's like, there's one other one.

00:12:59.794 --> 00:13:02.938
Oh, is there a fourth one?

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:04.519
Okay.

00:13:04.539 --> 00:13:07.923
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

00:13:07.943 --> 00:13:10.426
No, I think there's one.

00:13:10.446 --> 00:13:10.626
Okay.

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:12.568
Sure there is.

00:13:13.122 --> 00:13:23.118
All right, we have all our samples.

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:26.163
Oh, hold on.

00:13:26.183 --> 00:13:26.603
They're coming.

00:13:28.647 --> 00:13:31.150
So this is a really good way to get group consensus.

00:13:32.673 --> 00:13:36.619
By all means, you don't have to do this and collect a class or multiple class data set.

00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:40.345
But there's a really good way to think about, regardless of what you're doing,

00:13:40.645 --> 00:13:43.808
thinking about what kind of measurement uncertainty you're dealing with, right?

00:13:43.828 --> 00:13:47.452
So if you're measuring stem length, where are we measuring the radical from or whatever?

00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:49.934
So I like to group up students.

00:13:50.015 --> 00:13:58.403
And as a group, we come up with our rules so that we all are operating under the same protocol, so that when we collect all our data, we can use it to run.

00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:02.627
We have a higher sample size, and we run some descriptive statistics, right?

00:14:02.647 --> 00:14:03.989
We get that delta.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:07.272
So.

00:14:07.292 --> 00:14:08.273
I think he's got his own.

00:14:08.557 --> 00:14:10.800
I think we might have some new ones.

00:14:11.841 --> 00:14:17.529
This one right here looks like a completely different... Yeah, we've got some... The plantain goes there.

00:14:17.549 --> 00:14:21.834
I don't think anybody else has the strawberry.

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:32.488
Another reason why we chose to use the grass is because we're thinking in terms of school property, what do you have access to?

00:14:32.553 --> 00:14:35.055
So there's many directions you could take this.

00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:44.664
You could do like comparison between forest and lawn or just different places of the schoolyard, maybe where one area of this schoolyard gets more sun exposure, right?

00:14:44.704 --> 00:14:45.365
Something like this.

00:14:46.086 --> 00:14:48.948
A lot of room to differentiate.

00:14:51.191 --> 00:15:00.079
So what we have lined up, what we're going to do again is at this level we're not going to name them.

00:15:00.464 --> 00:15:02.614
or we will, but we're just going to name them with a letter.

00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:03.417
Okay?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.250
So this is where we start, right?

00:15:07.315 --> 00:15:08.601
We have these biro fights.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:24.076
Perhaps I'll grab a couple sample of these and I'll bring them to letter A so that everyone will know when they do the random sampling what letter A looks like or what species or specimen letter A is.

00:15:24.096 --> 00:15:27.540
Do you want us to write the species for you because we identified ours?

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.744
I think for now let's not do that because it'll take a little longer because not everyone has done that.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:33.566
Okay.

00:15:33.586 --> 00:15:35.128
But the next stage of this is

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:46.048
Looking at species A, once we have them all lined up, we will formulate our own description for each of our specimen, creating a key.

00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:50.052
So in classrooms where I've done this, I've actually had a big whiteboard.

00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:51.613
And it's all on one whiteboard.

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:53.415
And we tape a specimen.

00:15:53.735 --> 00:15:56.578
And we write a little description to help students along the way.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.123
What we did just now is we extrapolated this.

00:16:02.303 --> 00:16:05.706
And we transferred it amongst five different boards.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:13.169
Could we add the names later maybe?

00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:14.230
Yeah, you could.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.318
Oh yeah, that's another thing too is like what a great homework exercise, right?

00:16:19.919 --> 00:16:21.361
First you collect all the data.

00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:25.006
Maybe the next day you want to clean up the data and you want to use their names.

00:16:25.547 --> 00:16:34.961
Hey, perhaps at this stage everyone takes a picture of all the specimen they found and then they go home and they try to give that name to it, right?

00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:36.503
Maybe it's genus species.

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:38.158
Or maybe it's just a common name.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.402
We can give you common names.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:44.105
We already did it, if you want them.

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:46.548
We can write them.

00:16:46.568 --> 00:16:48.730
Either or, that's not the premise of this.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.013
So whatever you think is best.

00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:54.077
But the next stage here is giving each one a description.

00:16:54.577 --> 00:17:01.946
And I think the idea behind not giving a name right away, we're all so focused on knowing a name that we forget and then take a picture of something.

00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:05.410
But like when we began out by the friendship circle,

00:17:05.744 --> 00:17:10.571
This is more about connecting and getting to know something through making a personal connection.

00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:12.233
That's why the descriptors are so important.

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:15.278
Drawing that connection with students and stewardship in the land.

00:17:15.298 --> 00:17:17.701
Do you mind if I add a point to that?

00:17:18.062 --> 00:17:19.844
Someone explained it really well to me.

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:26.654
She said, when you meet someone, what's the first thing you usually learn about them is their name.

00:17:27.435 --> 00:17:28.917
And then how well do you know them?

00:17:29.588 --> 00:17:31.570
all you really know about them is their name.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:44.902
So when we're teaching kids about different species, there's a lot of benefit in learning the name eventually, but it's more interesting for them to really look at the organism and say, what makes this one different from that one?

00:17:45.263 --> 00:17:46.864
How do I know it's in this family?

00:17:46.904 --> 00:17:49.427
What similarities, what differences does it have?

00:17:49.447 --> 00:17:51.068
And then eventually they can learn the name.

00:17:51.649 --> 00:17:58.315
But just knowing the name of a plant doesn't always tell you that much about those species or the surroundings or anything.

00:17:58.335 --> 00:17:59.376
We'll play a name game later.

00:17:59.963 --> 00:18:01.065
with people's names.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:15.032
So I think at this point what we could do to continue modeling how you could do this in the classroom, can we come up with a general consensus for how to describe each of these viral fights here?

00:18:17.537 --> 00:18:20.783
Like as a whole, how did you guys describe them in your groups?

00:18:20.803 --> 00:18:22.005
You've already done this.

00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:26.396
We have one, two, three, four, maybe five samples.

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:28.938
So we have five different unique ways of describing this.

00:18:28.958 --> 00:18:31.681
Can we come up with a group consensus?

00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:32.081
Low.

00:18:32.642 --> 00:18:33.603
Low, spiky.

00:18:34.483 --> 00:18:35.584
We got low, spiky.

00:18:35.865 --> 00:18:37.306
Are we doing descriptions for you?

00:18:37.326 --> 00:18:37.947
Yeah.

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:38.928
OK.

00:18:38.948 --> 00:18:42.811
Green.

00:18:42.831 --> 00:18:45.454
Soft.

00:18:45.474 --> 00:18:46.075
Soft.

00:18:46.835 --> 00:18:48.177
Soft and spiky?

00:18:48.197 --> 00:18:49.017
Well, spiky shape.

00:18:49.137 --> 00:18:49.778
Yeah, that's soft.

00:18:49.898 --> 00:18:50.859
Yeah, that's OK, right?

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:51.840
Kind of feathery.

00:18:52.023 --> 00:18:52.924
Yeah.

00:18:52.984 --> 00:18:54.807
Maybe feathery more than spiky.

00:18:54.887 --> 00:18:55.188
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:56.489 --> 00:18:58.192
Feathery or leafy?

00:18:59.794 --> 00:19:03.439
So these two grasses are different than those grasses.

00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:04.000
Okay.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.162
Does that sound good to us?

00:19:05.943 --> 00:19:08.947
Okay, then we move on to the next one.

00:19:08.967 --> 00:19:13.834
How would you describe this plant?

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:19.903
So we have three leaves.

00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:22.347
What else do we have?

00:19:22.687 --> 00:19:24.369
White flowers.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:25.751
White flowers.

00:19:26.392 --> 00:19:35.684
Fibrous roots.

00:19:37.727 --> 00:19:38.248
Green.

00:19:38.708 --> 00:19:40.871
Say that the leaves are circular.

00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:47.460
Yeah, nice.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:57.378
Anybody else say something and we didn't hear?

00:19:57.398 --> 00:19:57.819
Feel free to keep up.

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:00.866
And if we look closer, I think like spreads being a rhizome.

00:20:01.688 --> 00:20:05.897
Yeah, we could get into like the science stuff that students already know, right?

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:09.685
Spreads.

00:20:14.356 --> 00:20:20.348
And then, like, I think something else, like, you know this is clover, but how do you know it's clover by that, like, white little marking, right?

00:20:20.889 --> 00:20:22.753
That's the type of clover, yeah.

00:20:22.793 --> 00:20:23.474
Lots of clovers.

00:20:24.055 --> 00:20:30.248
So, that's that leaf white marking.

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:34.997
Okay, so let's move the seed.

00:20:35.838 --> 00:20:36.699
We have arugula?

00:20:38.342 --> 00:20:38.983
Plantain.

00:20:39.624 --> 00:20:40.024
Plantain, yeah.

00:20:40.044 --> 00:20:41.386
Alright, let's describe it.

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.489
If you have a bug bite you can chew it up and put it on it.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.291
Green!

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:47.275
Broad oval leaf.

00:20:47.295 --> 00:20:50.239
Yeah, broad... clumps.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:59.774
Yeah, little rosettes of... Rose... Do any of them have their little spikes?

00:21:00.915 --> 00:21:03.499
I was going to say, there's some of them that have the flower coming up.

00:21:04.508 --> 00:21:30.921
and then we could say this is flower good description and it's where where is it located is it center in the center in center of clump of leaf clump i could add that in there and

00:21:32.437 --> 00:21:37.104
All right, what about the grass?

00:21:37.284 --> 00:21:37.825
What about this one?

00:21:38.186 --> 00:21:39.007
Guys, what color is it?

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:40.129
Green.

00:21:42.913 --> 00:21:44.796
Tell me about the leaves.

00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:47.921
Skinny.

00:21:48.802 --> 00:21:49.142
Flat.

00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:53.509
What is it called when they come off one stem?

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.751
Branching.

00:21:54.831 --> 00:21:57.415
Branching, yeah, branching.

00:21:58.441 --> 00:22:01.245
It's also nice to get the students to touch each one, right?

00:22:01.305 --> 00:22:04.168
To feel like what that stem does feel like, is it round or flat?

00:22:04.248 --> 00:22:11.878
Yes, those of you that have, we didn't have that one too.

00:22:11.918 --> 00:22:18.347
There's a term for when the leaf is blade-like, when it's sword-like.

00:22:18.627 --> 00:22:21.491
A bladed leaf?

00:22:21.591 --> 00:22:22.592
No, they're...

00:22:23.129 --> 00:22:33.159
I'm thinking of, like, gladiolas that are named after the Roman sword, but I feel like there's one that's a name for, like, the blade shape of grass, but I can't.

00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:34.881
Give it the blade shape of grass!

00:22:34.981 --> 00:22:38.344
I had parallel things.

00:22:38.364 --> 00:22:45.712
This one looks like... If you compare these two, right, like that one looks like you're quintessential of grass at home or something, right?

00:22:45.732 --> 00:22:46.873
That's that blade of grass.

00:22:46.933 --> 00:22:48.234
What's this little light thing?

00:22:49.956 --> 00:22:51.337
Oh, we haven't done height green.

00:22:51.618 --> 00:22:52.038
Height would be good.

00:22:52.058 --> 00:22:53.119
That's another thing, right?

00:22:53.285 --> 00:22:56.208
But that's something you can add in your class.

00:22:56.348 --> 00:22:58.631
You can measure all these things too.

00:22:58.891 --> 00:23:01.654
So these have like a V-shaped blade.

00:23:01.674 --> 00:23:06.859
They're going to have like a vein, a sedge.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:13.966
So, I mean, you can't write it back because it's named, but.

00:23:13.987 --> 00:23:18.912
And this one almost reminds me of pine needles coming out of a little fascicle.

00:23:18.932 --> 00:23:19.292
Yeah, it does.

00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:36.184
I mean, I know it's not connected like that, but that's what that reminds me of versus this one.

00:23:36.204 --> 00:23:37.125
You know your butterflies?

00:23:37.145 --> 00:23:39.608
Are you looking at them right now?

00:23:39.748 --> 00:23:39.908
OK.

00:23:39.948 --> 00:23:40.388
What time is it?

00:23:40.749 --> 00:23:42.911
I'm not good at butterflies, but I do like looking at them.

00:23:43.311 --> 00:23:45.213
I went to a butterfly farm, and we learned a lot there.

00:23:46.975 --> 00:23:47.035
OK.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:56.029
Okay, so at this point I do, if it's okay, we can go back to the stuff that is included in the criteria.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:01.682
So in your journals and thank you.

00:24:01.966 --> 00:24:09.696
So make a note that A is this guy, B is this, C is this, E is this, E is this, and then any others that you may note.

00:24:10.637 --> 00:24:13.340
You're going to diagram out your quadrat.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.466
You're going to label where the A's are, where the B's are.

00:24:17.486 --> 00:24:21.831
You're going to have a little data table of how many you think you can find.

00:24:22.638 --> 00:24:30.486
And all of that is written under the criteria, and there's also descriptions and examples in there, okay?

00:24:30.767 --> 00:24:35.051
So it's like the fourth page or something, it says criteria, and then it says examples.

00:24:35.632 --> 00:24:41.478
You can go count first and then come back to match which type you have.

00:24:41.518 --> 00:24:43.000
That's true too, yeah.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.680
You don't have to.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.103
Yeah, I think either way.

00:24:46.123 --> 00:24:47.644
Yeah, it's just whatever else you find.

00:24:47.664 --> 00:24:51.008
There's a lot of, well, most of ours is F. Yeah, I know.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:25:00.543
All right, toss that hula hoop somewhere.

00:25:00.743 --> 00:25:04.768
There's also these little tiny mats you can sit on if you don't want to get wet.

00:25:04.788 --> 00:25:05.488
I have our picture.

00:25:07.451 --> 00:25:08.251
We have our chart.

00:25:09.172 --> 00:25:20.505
We had this before, but we have A through F. We have a new A through F.

00:25:21.717 --> 00:25:39.263
And we need a circle on our... I have our circle.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:45.853
So, A was our moth, right?

00:25:47.015 --> 00:25:50.560
And we determined that our moth was all the same, so...

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.683
I mean the moss is pretty much all over it.

00:25:54.703 --> 00:25:59.890
Yeah, mostly on that side.

00:26:02.273 --> 00:26:03.675
Some sporadic right here.

00:26:21.157 --> 00:26:21.778
So that's A?

00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:25.651
Yep.

00:26:25.671 --> 00:26:31.618
I'm just gonna make a key and make that all A. Okay, that works.

00:26:34.601 --> 00:26:34.942
Okay.

00:26:38.947 --> 00:26:50.500
So now we need B. So can we do F and then indicate our original number if it's other?

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.002
Because most of ours are other.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:59.550
Okay.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:13.790
Because ours aren't the same as everybody else's.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.593
We also have rhomboid mercury.

00:27:18.408 --> 00:27:22.052
which would have been another in here.

00:27:22.072 --> 00:27:23.414
Okay, so how do we want to do this?

00:27:26.198 --> 00:27:30.663
So we do squigglies and so the straight lines for the key.

00:27:31.244 --> 00:27:34.147
Well, from here I mean individual plants I think.

00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:35.509
So this is the sedge, right?

00:27:35.689 --> 00:27:38.192
What number was the sedge or what letter was the sedge?

00:27:38.553 --> 00:27:40.956
I didn't have the photos on my phone.

00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:41.837
I have my phone over here.

00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:42.177
You're good.

00:27:47.023 --> 00:27:47.824
A.

00:27:48.631 --> 00:27:51.975
So, oh that's F. Gotta go backwards.

00:27:53.177 --> 00:27:55.059
So A is the moss, we did that.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.261
Drew it already.

00:27:56.862 --> 00:28:01.768
G is... B is... Clover.

00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:03.750
Do you see any clover?

00:28:03.851 --> 00:28:05.453
We had clover, we plucked the clover.

00:28:06.614 --> 00:28:07.495
Here's some clover.

00:28:07.555 --> 00:28:12.702
Tiny bit there.

00:28:13.283 --> 00:28:13.703
Where's yours?

00:28:15.085 --> 00:28:15.886
I just see yours.

00:28:16.487 --> 00:28:16.647
Hold on.

00:28:17.335 --> 00:28:18.036
There's some here.

00:28:18.056 --> 00:28:18.717
Here.

00:28:18.777 --> 00:28:25.648
That's it?

00:28:26.309 --> 00:28:26.710
I think so.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:27.411
Oh, there's a bee.

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.716
Oh.

00:28:30.736 --> 00:28:31.157
Yep.

00:28:31.177 --> 00:28:31.978
This is a tiny one.

00:28:34.061 --> 00:28:34.482
Maybe there.

00:28:36.626 --> 00:28:38.068
One right here.

00:28:40.071 --> 00:28:41.934
Just a tiny one.

00:28:41.954 --> 00:28:42.174
Okay.

00:28:43.336 --> 00:28:43.917
So A.

00:28:45.398 --> 00:28:49.585
B. C is plantain.

00:28:49.645 --> 00:28:51.508
So this is plantain.

00:28:51.528 --> 00:29:09.516
So C, C, C, C, C. Did you get this?

00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:11.180
in a second.

00:29:11.201 --> 00:29:11.301
Okay.

00:29:11.321 --> 00:29:12.722
Moving in that direction.

00:29:12.763 --> 00:29:13.063
Okay.

00:29:13.664 --> 00:29:14.585
Would you say this is the same?

00:29:15.947 --> 00:29:16.808
It is smaller.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.451
Wasn't that self-heal?

00:29:20.833 --> 00:29:22.014
What's our letter self-heal?

00:29:22.175 --> 00:29:24.438
So that's F of what?

00:29:25.519 --> 00:29:28.623
We had self-heal as D previously.

00:29:29.023 --> 00:29:30.906
F of D. F of D!

00:29:31.907 --> 00:29:36.373
And then there's a nice big C here.

00:29:36.393 --> 00:29:38.035
I guess that's kind of here.

00:29:38.453 --> 00:29:40.235
Yeah, on the border of the moss.

00:29:40.355 --> 00:29:40.655
Here.

00:29:40.695 --> 00:29:44.479
Was this self-heal too?

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:52.067
So F of D. F of D. And that's self-heal.

00:29:52.788 --> 00:29:57.132
F of D. Plantain over there, right?

00:29:57.352 --> 00:30:04.139
So that's C. Moving back across.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.583
Plantain here.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:22.423
I'm only writing self-heal because it's similar to... That be self-heal?

00:30:25.428 --> 00:30:27.551
And do they compete?

00:30:27.572 --> 00:30:34.363
And there's a sea there.

00:30:45.397 --> 00:30:52.468
Okay.

00:30:52.488 --> 00:30:57.295
Do you want to do flat branching?

00:30:57.395 --> 00:30:59.038
Oh, is that the crabgrass?

00:30:59.098 --> 00:31:00.620
Do we have any crabgrass?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.621
We shouldn't have.

00:31:01.641 --> 00:31:02.483
I didn't write that down.

00:31:04.185 --> 00:31:05.447
Is this crabgrass?

00:31:06.228 --> 00:31:08.432
We may not have grabbed it initially.

00:31:08.452 --> 00:31:10.214
This one?

00:31:10.254 --> 00:31:14.020
Yeah, let's see.

00:31:16.868 --> 00:31:29.500
I mean, it would be logical for us to have crabgrass.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.501
We have bluegrass.

00:31:35.686 --> 00:31:43.053
I don't see crabgrass in ours.

00:31:43.093 --> 00:31:44.715
So we'll leave that one out.

00:31:45.067 --> 00:31:46.649
Our broad one is bluegrass.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.892
Our broad one is bluegrass?

00:31:50.793 --> 00:31:51.033
Yeah.

00:31:52.374 --> 00:31:55.097
Our broad grass is bluegrass.

00:32:01.043 --> 00:32:02.104
And bear sedge.

00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.546
And whatever this is.

00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:08.410
Japanese stiltgrass.

00:32:09.211 --> 00:32:12.174
So we have grasses, but we don't have crabgrass.

00:32:13.235 --> 00:32:14.196
So we can't mark that one.

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.084
E was the sedge.

00:32:21.426 --> 00:32:22.407
Do you want to draw on the sedge?

00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:26.352
How are we going to... E?

00:32:26.392 --> 00:32:26.872
I can do it.

00:32:27.553 --> 00:32:29.856
So yeah, E's are like around here.

00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:37.785
E, E. There's a lot of... So this is the sedge?

00:32:38.426 --> 00:32:44.132
Yes.

00:32:45.395 --> 00:32:46.536
There's a little E there.

00:32:46.576 --> 00:32:47.958
There's some here.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.541
You got these already.

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:04.939
Okay.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.721
Really we don't have that much more.

00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:07.702
It's in the sunny area.

00:33:08.103 --> 00:33:09.284
What did you list as D?

00:33:09.685 --> 00:33:10.686
Do we even have D?

00:33:12.608 --> 00:33:13.950
That's the one we didn't have, right?

00:33:15.382 --> 00:33:23.373
Because we had a lot of the F. D was the crabgrass, which we didn't have.

00:33:23.393 --> 00:33:24.935
Okay.

00:33:24.955 --> 00:33:27.098
E was the sedge.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.660
F is other.

00:33:29.121 --> 00:33:33.447
Yep.

00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:36.331
So, which one was our stiltgrass?

00:33:37.993 --> 00:33:39.535
Stiltgrass.

00:33:39.555 --> 00:33:39.996
F of what?

00:33:40.236 --> 00:33:41.298
So this is stiltgrass.

00:33:41.338 --> 00:33:43.060
What did you give it as a letter?

00:33:43.781 --> 00:33:44.722
From the previous one?

00:33:44.883 --> 00:33:45.203
Yeah.

00:33:45.942 --> 00:33:46.843
Japanese soul.

00:33:47.844 --> 00:33:49.706
That was C, previously.

00:33:49.806 --> 00:33:54.110
So that's C there, and a lot up at the top.

00:34:10.946 --> 00:34:11.967
What did we call our bread?

00:34:12.027 --> 00:34:15.831
We had bluegrass, so what was our letter for bluegrass?

00:34:19.507 --> 00:34:22.551
Do we have bluegrass?

00:34:23.973 --> 00:34:25.416
Mm-hmm.

00:34:25.436 --> 00:34:26.537
Might have been one of our bottoms.

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:33.167
That was probably the last one you mentioned and I didn't get to write it down.

00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:34.188
So N?

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.914
Okay, yep.

00:34:37.934 --> 00:34:38.815
F of N.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:57.048
What was strawberry?

00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:59.551
Mock strawberry?

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:01.373
Did you get it?

00:35:02.275 --> 00:35:03.937
I. I?

00:35:04.337 --> 00:35:07.782
Yeah.

00:35:07.802 --> 00:35:11.367
F of I. F of I. We have a lot of strawberry.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:26.822
Other things you notice that you want to write down that we should have a lot of, that we wrote on our thing.

00:35:31.068 --> 00:35:32.450
You already got the self-heal, right?

00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:33.892
Yes, we got the self-heal.

00:35:34.713 --> 00:35:34.813
Okay.

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:37.978
Because that was so similar to plantain, we wrote it down at the same time.

00:35:43.274 --> 00:36:10.277
um beef stick did we do that which one was that i don't know or did we pluck it we plucked it i know for sure because that's the one we wrote about i think it's these what letter was that beef stick was or beef steak was e f of e yeah i have two up here f of e's

00:36:11.978 --> 00:36:13.852
Yep, that one.

00:36:13.872 --> 00:36:15.424
Yeah, this one's been pulled.
