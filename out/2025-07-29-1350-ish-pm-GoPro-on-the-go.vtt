00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:06.421
Here's the trail after a brief conversation.

00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:09.465
Just looking at some of it.

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:11.648
It's called the West Prong Trail.

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:16.395
We have some kid right here who's in timeout at the moment.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.158
They put me in timeout.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:38.121
see what happens when you don't follow expectations because i don't drop anything dumping water in his mouth oh so we hydrate our teammates okay you want to pour some water in my mouth one at a time just go buy a bucket who could squeeze squirt some water in my mouth

00:00:38.101 --> 00:01:05.222
Feel a little weird, but we can do it Forest trees last part Positive behaviors only see here's a trail up here that we're not going on but

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:22.789
it is very far up you can see some of the forestry on the left you see tree trunks the roots of trees that have fallen you see fungus

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.328
that have grown on tree limbs.

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:30.494
You see other fallen trees, mushrooms, things of that sort.

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:40.706
See the crew down here as they get themselves prepared for the adventure of hiking this wonderful trail.

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:44.451
We're going in groups of twos, as you may have heard.

00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.556
Reach one, teach one, I believe is what it's called.

00:01:49.697 --> 00:01:53.822
And as we do that, we will be learning from each other.

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:58.747
and also using our teaching skills to instruct each other.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.998
And that is the tutorial.

00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:04.453
Probably everything for this video you can probably...

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.174
Yeah, you can edit it out or you can keep it.

00:02:09.214 --> 00:02:17.342
But we are definitely going to have a fantastic time, even though that's not an educational word to use.

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:20.725
But we are currently in waiting.

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:28.393
So we're going to look around at some of the shrubbery, the forestry that we are in.

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:32.837
This trail right here, of course, is well traveled.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:36.605
I'm not there by myself because it is not smart.

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:40.268
And we see a spider web right here.

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:47.775
Do not know what kind of spider that is, but I will not get close enough to find out because it is not healthy for a human.

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:52.459
We're going to back away and we're going to walk back down.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.681
Oh, never mind.

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.342
We're going to stop here.

00:02:55.402 --> 00:02:56.663
You see the algae on this tree?

00:02:57.924 --> 00:03:01.407
It is nice or fungus or both.

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:03.830
Could be a mix of both.

00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.295
I believe those are mushrooms, some of that sort.

00:03:10.196 --> 00:03:12.418
Not mushrooms, but more probably fungus and whatnot.

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:31.495
So yeah, we're gonna walk back down to the bottom and show this huge park that we are engulfed in.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.005
and to share with all of you who are gonna be watching the video.

00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:39.647
So I will be back in a moment.

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:40.848
Oh, nevermind, scratch that.

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:41.549
I'm gonna stay on.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.033
So I wanna go up a little more just because our team has not been called yet.

00:03:47.014 --> 00:03:48.715
You see lots of forms of grass.

00:03:49.956 --> 00:03:59.305
You see lots of vegetation that is growing about this forest, which,

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:03.234
is why they call the Great Smoky Forest or Great Smoky Mountains, rather.

00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:14.454
Excuse my miss timing or miss naming it or misguiding the name I quoted.

00:04:15.376 --> 00:04:16.939
But here we are.

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:21.677
So I'm going to stop here because I don't want to get lost in the forest.

00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:30.329
But as we see, we have our other cohort on the film down below named Alicia.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.799
And then we see that the rocks up here as part of the trail that we'll be walking.

00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:40.703
I don't want to get too far to touch.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:45.610
So I'm going to go about right here where we have

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:53.465
Of course, the tree trunk has been uprooted, most likely by storm or just nature.

00:04:54.607 --> 00:05:12.954
As you can see, you can see how the roots have started turning into a different vegetation now that has been toppled, which means for the looks of it's toppled a long time ago.

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:16.339
And with that being noted and said,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.432
it then turns into something else.

00:05:18.452 --> 00:05:38.462
So it like grows, not grows, but it molds itself into nature as it sinks, as it starts to be engulfed in the soil beneath it and becomes a different asset to nature.

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:49.119
And up here, you see how the trail goes way up there, way up there.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:57.611
It kind of has looks like it had like a wood railing to the right, down the camera to the left.

00:05:57.631 --> 00:05:58.291
That's pretty cool.

00:05:59.233 --> 00:05:59.713
Pretty cool.

00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:06.502
Now we'll head back down before my group leaves me because I just may do that.

00:06:08.365 --> 00:06:09.486
We don't want that to happen.

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:12.330
I'm going to come back down.

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:19.570
with society and I will reach out to you all shortly.
