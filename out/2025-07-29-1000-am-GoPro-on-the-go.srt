1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,474
Tell you're recording because then... Okay, it is.

2
00:00:02,514 --> 00:00:03,014
Yeah, you're good.

3
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:06,078
We're running out of our eight minutes.

4
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:09,542
Oh, I'll just let you go, sorry.

5
00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:10,083
Hello.

6
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:15,930
I want to get something different.

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,230
Okay.

8
00:00:18,032 --> 00:00:19,273
So are you just tossing it?

9
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:22,137
Or do we want to include any of that?

10
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:24,540
Okay, so eight minutes.

11
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:29,245
So basically nine, or not nine, 10-08.

12
00:00:31,148 --> 00:00:57,139
okay okay so we just write down as many do we want to do we have to identify them or just pick them i know that he said both and he was like a through e or something of the sort is five here you want to write them down okay moss i want to say this is strawberry wild strawberry um

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,722
That might be nimblewill, but this is not.

14
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:06,346
This is maybe a sedge.

15
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,488
And then this is a different type of grass.

16
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:10,369
This is plantain.

17
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,632
Do you know what this is?

18
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:15,874
I'm not a plant girl.

19
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:21,179
I'm actually astounded by all the stuff you pulled already and was able to name.

20
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,040
Clover.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,885
This is another type of grass.

22
00:01:29,468 --> 00:01:30,750
They just come up.

23
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:45,091
This is another type of plant.

24
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,214
It's like a creeping plant.

25
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:57,889
This little buddy I think is different as well.

26
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:20,822
we just we're not going for numbers we're just going for types yeah so it had for an example they had a through f then we can use i naturalists

27
00:02:22,287 --> 00:02:26,812
Different types of moss.

28
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,035
This one, there's two types of moss.

29
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:35,222
There's this moss and then there's like this one.

30
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:38,786
Did you get the, this one?

31
00:02:38,806 --> 00:02:40,689
Is it a plantain?

32
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,837
Self heal?

33
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:48,017
Yeah.

34
00:02:48,077 --> 00:02:49,459
This is a plantain.

35
00:02:50,452 --> 00:03:02,250
Ooh, what's in that?

36
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,814
Oh, they count.

37
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,056
It's gonna be a fungi.

38
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:07,819
It's a fungi.

39
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:14,010
Okay, this is not confident.

40
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:17,094
We broke the system.

41
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,757
This is also different.

42
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:25,885
This is a different type of moss thing.

43
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:33,215
You can take from my pile and identify them too.

44
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:40,945
This won't focus on it.

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,542
Yeah, I won't focus on it.

46
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,123
It's okay.

47
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:44,984
Michelle, are you guys good?

48
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:46,406
Oh, we're good.

49
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:47,527
Okay.

50
00:03:47,547 --> 00:03:47,988
We're done?

51
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,810
Can we come back?

52
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:52,554
I thought we had eight minutes.

53
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:57,320
Well, you were all gonna go.

54
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,083
Ready?

55
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:02,306
Okay.

56
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,330
Artifacts, stay where you are.

57
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,490
Okay.

58
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,036
So when I watch you, can you guys all hear me?

59
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:10,236
Yes, sir.

60
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,117
So this is what I want everybody to do now.

61
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:18,033
I want you to look at your artifacts, and I want you to make observations on each one.

62
00:04:18,053 --> 00:04:20,136
Don't bother giving it a name yet, right?

63
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:20,837
I don't like the look of it.

64
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:24,822
I'm just trying to describe and discern the difference between the samples we collected.

65
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:28,607
Write a little heat description for each, okay?

66
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:33,754
And if you want, you can name it.

67
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,318
But that will change as we get a group consensus after this.

68
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:38,420
Okay, group consensus.

69
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,620
Oh, wait.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,362
You guys got a map to set on?

71
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,395
Yeah, that would be most appreciative, thank you.

72
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:51,866
Where can you write this at?

73
00:04:53,067 --> 00:05:00,056
I just put it in your- Ohhhh.

74
00:05:00,076 --> 00:05:02,258
You left it up there.

75
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:02,379
Yep.

76
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:02,499
Okay.

77
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:10,028
Okay, so the first one I've got is our fungi living on a branch.

78
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:18,062
Okay.

79
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,529
Are they a lichen or are they a fungi?

80
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:22,692
I think those are fungi.

81
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,406
It wasn't working on mine, did it work on yours?

82
00:05:29,687 --> 00:05:32,372
There's also some crustose lichen on there.

83
00:05:33,114 --> 00:05:33,214
Okay.

84
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,979
He said not to identify him.

85
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:38,922
That's just A. Okay.

86
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,784
We're not really focused on him, but you can if you want.

87
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:42,046
I mean, you're on a high school level.

88
00:05:42,186 --> 00:05:43,648
If you want to be able to use names.

89
00:05:43,668 --> 00:05:44,148
That's better.

90
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,532
But as we do this, it gets kind of confusing, right?

91
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:50,557
Because everyone has different samples from these spots they surveyed.

92
00:05:50,577 --> 00:05:54,782
So A and then B. One second.

93
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,685
Let me, I'm pulling up a picture of this.

94
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:57,666
Okay.

95
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:15,436
Now it's on the stick.

96
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,962
Yeah.

97
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:23,525
What is it?

98
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,467
It's mushrooms.

99
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:30,372
Got that wrong.

100
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,174
Can I toss him back?

101
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:35,577
Yeah.

102
00:06:35,657 --> 00:06:35,978
Okay.

103
00:06:36,738 --> 00:06:38,380
I'm pretty sure that was the one that was pulled in.

104
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,942
Next one is a mock.

105
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:40,242
So B is

106
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:46,384
The moss, like, it's right... zominate or isome.

107
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:55,493
It's a rhizome.

108
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,438
Okay.

109
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:01,779
Moss.

110
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:08,305
Okay.

111
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:39,034
and a little bit when you guys are done I'm going to grab the other one in the middle okay so you can grab everything okay you want us to bring our samples yeah okay so keep the samples yeah when I'm done with them I'm going to put them in everything okay see if this is the same thing see are we just going to do a through f or are we wanting to do all of them I'm going to try to do all of them okay he's rushing me

112
00:07:40,988 --> 00:07:42,610
So this one's the same thing.

113
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:50,179
So moving on to C, which is in the grass family.

114
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,641
It's like one minute.

115
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:52,722
Good.

116
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:53,503
You guys need more than a minute.

117
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:54,344
More than a minute.

118
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:55,085
More?

119
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:57,127
OK.

120
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,250
How's two minutes now?

121
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,751
I suppose I could see.

122
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:04,656
How many minutes do you need?

123
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:04,996
Two.

124
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:05,477
How many you got?

125
00:08:05,497 --> 00:08:05,938
I got tons of time.

126
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,441
Oh.

127
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:09,502
We got like 40 minutes.

128
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:09,662
And 40.

129
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:16,455
Japanese Stiltgrass.

130
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:29,572
Uh, yes.

131
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:38,703
Okay.

132
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:40,105
So we were perfect.

133
00:08:43,983 --> 00:09:05,012
what is that noise we finished and they were like

134
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,003
That's it, that's all you want me to do?

135
00:09:10,303 --> 00:09:11,344
And I was like, okay, maybe that wasn't good enough.

136
00:09:11,364 --> 00:09:13,707
So each year I've been trying to make it a little bit more complex, and I'm definitely going to try it.

137
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,668
Beefsteak plant.

138
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:16,329
Like beef?

139
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:18,951
Yeah, or purple mint.

140
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:19,992
Chinese basil.

141
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:21,714
Those are all common names.

142
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:30,341
It's also sick because, oh, where have you put all of our little, were you putting them back?

143
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,744
Oh shoot, they're all right here though.

144
00:09:32,764 --> 00:09:33,384
Take them back.

145
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:34,425
They're all right here though.

146
00:09:35,587 --> 00:10:01,645
hmm well you threw the one moss in there so okay then yeah we have our three samples there okay so what was beef stick again it was just beef stick something you're good oh I have okay I have all of it okay

147
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:03,777
It's just different.

148
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:06,120
I want to say this is another beef steak.

149
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,201
Okay.

150
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:08,082
This, wouldn't you say?

151
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:09,904
We already have that, so.

152
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:14,269
Yeah, it looks like it matches with the front.

153
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,452
Almost there.

154
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,282
White Havens.

155
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:27,683
A-B-E-N-S.

156
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:29,624
A-V-E-N-S?

157
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:31,948
Yes.

158
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:32,969
Okay.

159
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:39,859
So that should be F?

160
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:39,959
Yep.

161
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:46,748
Is that the same grass?

162
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,574
Somebody else though?

163
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:52,316
Oh, yep.

164
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,277
He just pointed at us.

165
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:55,881
Uh, Asiatic Dave?

166
00:10:55,861 --> 00:11:10,398
Lay them out so everyone can see them.

167
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,580
If you guys are done.

168
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,102
If you're not done, it's okay.

169
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:16,065
Take one more minute to wrap up what you're up to.

170
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:24,315
You can do both at the same time.

171
00:11:26,523 --> 00:11:28,365
Did we get enough?

172
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:29,747
We're at G, right here.

173
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:29,867
Yeah.

174
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:33,831
Well, you just said aviatic days flower.

175
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:38,777
Yeah, so more on G. This one's going to be a plantain probably.

176
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:44,063
What do we be after G?

177
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,405
Black seed plantain.

178
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:52,613
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. So you guys are probably good.

179
00:11:52,633 --> 00:11:52,733
Yeah.

180
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,235
So black seed plantain.

181
00:11:54,957 --> 00:12:10,603
okay you take that pile i'll take this okay black seed champagne plantain oh like yep got you all right time has expired

182
00:12:13,469 --> 00:12:42,548
So as you guys bring over your samples, you'll be organizing and lumping them with their lights.

183
00:12:43,557 --> 00:12:45,960
I think that got them wrong.

184
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,322
I've already laid them down.

185
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:49,523
We had, she grabbed them.

186
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:52,567
There's like four different things.

187
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:55,990
Like grasses, like super wispy mediums.

188
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,712
Isn't this me and others?

189
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:57,992
Yeah, my bad.

190
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:58,393
You're right.

191
00:12:58,413 --> 00:12:59,774
Well, and then there's like, there's one other one.

192
00:12:59,794 --> 00:13:02,938
Oh, is there a fourth one?

193
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,519
Okay.

194
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:07,923
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

195
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:10,426
No, I think there's one.

196
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:10,626
Okay.

197
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,568
Sure there is.

198
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:23,118
All right, we have all our samples.

199
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,163
Oh, hold on.

200
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:26,603
They're coming.

201
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:31,150
So this is a really good way to get group consensus.

202
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:36,619
By all means, you don't have to do this and collect a class or multiple class data set.

203
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,345
But there's a really good way to think about, regardless of what you're doing,

204
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:43,808
thinking about what kind of measurement uncertainty you're dealing with, right?

205
00:13:43,828 --> 00:13:47,452
So if you're measuring stem length, where are we measuring the radical from or whatever?

206
00:13:48,753 --> 00:13:49,934
So I like to group up students.

207
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:58,403
And as a group, we come up with our rules so that we all are operating under the same protocol, so that when we collect all our data, we can use it to run.

208
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:02,627
We have a higher sample size, and we run some descriptive statistics, right?

209
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:03,989
We get that delta.

210
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,272
So.

211
00:14:07,292 --> 00:14:08,273
I think he's got his own.

212
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,800
I think we might have some new ones.

213
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:17,529
This one right here looks like a completely different... Yeah, we've got some... The plantain goes there.

214
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:21,834
I don't think anybody else has the strawberry.

215
00:14:21,874 --> 00:14:32,488
Another reason why we chose to use the grass is because we're thinking in terms of school property, what do you have access to?

216
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:35,055
So there's many directions you could take this.

217
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:44,664
You could do like comparison between forest and lawn or just different places of the schoolyard, maybe where one area of this schoolyard gets more sun exposure, right?

218
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:45,365
Something like this.

219
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,948
A lot of room to differentiate.

220
00:14:51,191 --> 00:15:00,079
So what we have lined up, what we're going to do again is at this level we're not going to name them.

221
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:02,614
or we will, but we're just going to name them with a letter.

222
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:03,417
Okay?

223
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,250
So this is where we start, right?

224
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:08,601
We have these biro fights.

225
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:24,076
Perhaps I'll grab a couple sample of these and I'll bring them to letter A so that everyone will know when they do the random sampling what letter A looks like or what species or specimen letter A is.

226
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:27,540
Do you want us to write the species for you because we identified ours?

227
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,744
I think for now let's not do that because it'll take a little longer because not everyone has done that.

228
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,566
Okay.

229
00:15:33,586 --> 00:15:35,128
But the next stage of this is

230
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:46,048
Looking at species A, once we have them all lined up, we will formulate our own description for each of our specimen, creating a key.

231
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,052
So in classrooms where I've done this, I've actually had a big whiteboard.

232
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:51,613
And it's all on one whiteboard.

233
00:15:51,633 --> 00:15:53,415
And we tape a specimen.

234
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:56,578
And we write a little description to help students along the way.

235
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,123
What we did just now is we extrapolated this.

236
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,706
And we transferred it amongst five different boards.

237
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,169
Could we add the names later maybe?

238
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:14,230
Yeah, you could.

239
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:19,318
Oh yeah, that's another thing too is like what a great homework exercise, right?

240
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,361
First you collect all the data.

241
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:25,006
Maybe the next day you want to clean up the data and you want to use their names.

242
00:16:25,547 --> 00:16:34,961
Hey, perhaps at this stage everyone takes a picture of all the specimen they found and then they go home and they try to give that name to it, right?

243
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:36,503
Maybe it's genus species.

244
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,158
Or maybe it's just a common name.

245
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,402
We can give you common names.

246
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,105
We already did it, if you want them.

247
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:46,548
We can write them.

248
00:16:46,568 --> 00:16:48,730
Either or, that's not the premise of this.

249
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,013
So whatever you think is best.

250
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:54,077
But the next stage here is giving each one a description.

251
00:16:54,577 --> 00:17:01,946
And I think the idea behind not giving a name right away, we're all so focused on knowing a name that we forget and then take a picture of something.

252
00:17:02,426 --> 00:17:05,410
But like when we began out by the friendship circle,

253
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:10,571
This is more about connecting and getting to know something through making a personal connection.

254
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,233
That's why the descriptors are so important.

255
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,278
Drawing that connection with students and stewardship in the land.

256
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:17,701
Do you mind if I add a point to that?

257
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,844
Someone explained it really well to me.

258
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:26,654
She said, when you meet someone, what's the first thing you usually learn about them is their name.

259
00:17:27,435 --> 00:17:28,917
And then how well do you know them?

260
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:31,570
all you really know about them is their name.

261
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:44,902
So when we're teaching kids about different species, there's a lot of benefit in learning the name eventually, but it's more interesting for them to really look at the organism and say, what makes this one different from that one?

262
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,864
How do I know it's in this family?

263
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,427
What similarities, what differences does it have?

264
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:51,068
And then eventually they can learn the name.

265
00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:58,315
But just knowing the name of a plant doesn't always tell you that much about those species or the surroundings or anything.

266
00:17:58,335 --> 00:17:59,376
We'll play a name game later.

267
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,065
with people's names.

268
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:15,032
So I think at this point what we could do to continue modeling how you could do this in the classroom, can we come up with a general consensus for how to describe each of these viral fights here?

269
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:20,783
Like as a whole, how did you guys describe them in your groups?

270
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:22,005
You've already done this.

271
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:26,396
We have one, two, three, four, maybe five samples.

272
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,938
So we have five different unique ways of describing this.

273
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,681
Can we come up with a group consensus?

274
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:32,081
Low.

275
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:33,603
Low, spiky.

276
00:18:34,483 --> 00:18:35,584
We got low, spiky.

277
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,306
Are we doing descriptions for you?

278
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:37,947
Yeah.

279
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:38,928
OK.

280
00:18:38,948 --> 00:18:42,811
Green.

281
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,454
Soft.

282
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:46,075
Soft.

283
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,177
Soft and spiky?

284
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:49,017
Well, spiky shape.

285
00:18:49,137 --> 00:18:49,778
Yeah, that's soft.

286
00:18:49,898 --> 00:18:50,859
Yeah, that's OK, right?

287
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,840
Kind of feathery.

288
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:52,924
Yeah.

289
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:54,807
Maybe feathery more than spiky.

290
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:55,188
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:18:56,489 --> 00:18:58,192
Feathery or leafy?

292
00:18:59,794 --> 00:19:03,439
So these two grasses are different than those grasses.

293
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:04,000
Okay.

294
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,162
Does that sound good to us?

295
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,947
Okay, then we move on to the next one.

296
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:13,834
How would you describe this plant?

297
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:19,903
So we have three leaves.

298
00:19:21,065 --> 00:19:22,347
What else do we have?

299
00:19:22,687 --> 00:19:24,369
White flowers.

300
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,751
White flowers.

301
00:19:26,392 --> 00:19:35,684
Fibrous roots.

302
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:38,248
Green.

303
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:40,871
Say that the leaves are circular.

304
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:47,460
Yeah, nice.

305
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:57,378
Anybody else say something and we didn't hear?

306
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:57,819
Feel free to keep up.

307
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,866
And if we look closer, I think like spreads being a rhizome.

308
00:20:01,688 --> 00:20:05,897
Yeah, we could get into like the science stuff that students already know, right?

309
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:09,685
Spreads.

310
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:20,348
And then, like, I think something else, like, you know this is clover, but how do you know it's clover by that, like, white little marking, right?

311
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,753
That's the type of clover, yeah.

312
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:23,474
Lots of clovers.

313
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:30,248
So, that's that leaf white marking.

314
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,997
Okay, so let's move the seed.

315
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:36,699
We have arugula?

316
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:38,983
Plantain.

317
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:40,024
Plantain, yeah.

318
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:41,386
Alright, let's describe it.

319
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,489
If you have a bug bite you can chew it up and put it on it.

320
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,291
Green!

321
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:47,275
Broad oval leaf.

322
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:50,239
Yeah, broad... clumps.

323
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:59,774
Yeah, little rosettes of... Rose... Do any of them have their little spikes?

324
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:03,499
I was going to say, there's some of them that have the flower coming up.

325
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:30,921
and then we could say this is flower good description and it's where where is it located is it center in the center in center of clump of leaf clump i could add that in there and

326
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:37,104
All right, what about the grass?

327
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:37,825
What about this one?

328
00:21:38,186 --> 00:21:39,007
Guys, what color is it?

329
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:40,129
Green.

330
00:21:42,913 --> 00:21:44,796
Tell me about the leaves.

331
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,921
Skinny.

332
00:21:48,802 --> 00:21:49,142
Flat.

333
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:53,509
What is it called when they come off one stem?

334
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,751
Branching.

335
00:21:54,831 --> 00:21:57,415
Branching, yeah, branching.

336
00:21:58,441 --> 00:22:01,245
It's also nice to get the students to touch each one, right?

337
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:04,168
To feel like what that stem does feel like, is it round or flat?

338
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:11,878
Yes, those of you that have, we didn't have that one too.

339
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:18,347
There's a term for when the leaf is blade-like, when it's sword-like.

340
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:21,491
A bladed leaf?

341
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,592
No, they're...

342
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:33,159
I'm thinking of, like, gladiolas that are named after the Roman sword, but I feel like there's one that's a name for, like, the blade shape of grass, but I can't.

343
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:34,881
Give it the blade shape of grass!

344
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:38,344
I had parallel things.

345
00:22:38,364 --> 00:22:45,712
This one looks like... If you compare these two, right, like that one looks like you're quintessential of grass at home or something, right?

346
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:46,873
That's that blade of grass.

347
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,234
What's this little light thing?

348
00:22:49,956 --> 00:22:51,337
Oh, we haven't done height green.

349
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:52,038
Height would be good.

350
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:53,119
That's another thing, right?

351
00:22:53,285 --> 00:22:56,208
But that's something you can add in your class.

352
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,631
You can measure all these things too.

353
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:01,654
So these have like a V-shaped blade.

354
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:06,859
They're going to have like a vein, a sedge.

355
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,966
So, I mean, you can't write it back because it's named, but.

356
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:18,912
And this one almost reminds me of pine needles coming out of a little fascicle.

357
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:19,292
Yeah, it does.

358
00:23:19,728 --> 00:23:36,184
I mean, I know it's not connected like that, but that's what that reminds me of versus this one.

359
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:37,125
You know your butterflies?

360
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:39,608
Are you looking at them right now?

361
00:23:39,748 --> 00:23:39,908
OK.

362
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:40,388
What time is it?

363
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:42,911
I'm not good at butterflies, but I do like looking at them.

364
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:45,213
I went to a butterfly farm, and we learned a lot there.

365
00:23:46,975 --> 00:23:47,035
OK.

366
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:56,029
Okay, so at this point I do, if it's okay, we can go back to the stuff that is included in the criteria.

367
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:01,682
So in your journals and thank you.

368
00:24:01,966 --> 00:24:09,696
So make a note that A is this guy, B is this, C is this, E is this, E is this, and then any others that you may note.

369
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:13,340
You're going to diagram out your quadrat.

370
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,466
You're going to label where the A's are, where the B's are.

371
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:21,831
You're going to have a little data table of how many you think you can find.

372
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:30,486
And all of that is written under the criteria, and there's also descriptions and examples in there, okay?

373
00:24:30,767 --> 00:24:35,051
So it's like the fourth page or something, it says criteria, and then it says examples.

374
00:24:35,632 --> 00:24:41,478
You can go count first and then come back to match which type you have.

375
00:24:41,518 --> 00:24:43,000
That's true too, yeah.

376
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,680
You don't have to.

377
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,103
Yeah, I think either way.

378
00:24:46,123 --> 00:24:47,644
Yeah, it's just whatever else you find.

379
00:24:47,664 --> 00:24:51,008
There's a lot of, well, most of ours is F. Yeah, I know.

380
00:24:52,574 --> 00:25:00,543
All right, toss that hula hoop somewhere.

381
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:04,768
There's also these little tiny mats you can sit on if you don't want to get wet.

382
00:25:04,788 --> 00:25:05,488
I have our picture.

383
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:08,251
We have our chart.

384
00:25:09,172 --> 00:25:20,505
We had this before, but we have A through F. We have a new A through F.

385
00:25:21,717 --> 00:25:39,263
And we need a circle on our... I have our circle.

386
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,853
So, A was our moth, right?

387
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:50,560
And we determined that our moth was all the same, so...

388
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,683
I mean the moss is pretty much all over it.

389
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:59,890
Yeah, mostly on that side.

390
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:03,675
Some sporadic right here.

391
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:21,778
So that's A?

392
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:25,651
Yep.

393
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:31,618
I'm just gonna make a key and make that all A. Okay, that works.

394
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:34,942
Okay.

395
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:50,500
So now we need B. So can we do F and then indicate our original number if it's other?

396
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,002
Because most of ours are other.

397
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,550
Okay.

398
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:13,790
Because ours aren't the same as everybody else's.

399
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,593
We also have rhomboid mercury.

400
00:27:18,408 --> 00:27:22,052
which would have been another in here.

401
00:27:22,072 --> 00:27:23,414
Okay, so how do we want to do this?

402
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:30,663
So we do squigglies and so the straight lines for the key.

403
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:34,147
Well, from here I mean individual plants I think.

404
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,509
So this is the sedge, right?

405
00:27:35,689 --> 00:27:38,192
What number was the sedge or what letter was the sedge?

406
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,956
I didn't have the photos on my phone.

407
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:41,837
I have my phone over here.

408
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:42,177
You're good.

409
00:27:47,023 --> 00:27:47,824
A.

410
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:51,975
So, oh that's F. Gotta go backwards.

411
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:55,059
So A is the moss, we did that.

412
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,261
Drew it already.

413
00:27:56,862 --> 00:28:01,768
G is... B is... Clover.

414
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:03,750
Do you see any clover?

415
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,453
We had clover, we plucked the clover.

416
00:28:06,614 --> 00:28:07,495
Here's some clover.

417
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:12,702
Tiny bit there.

418
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:13,703
Where's yours?

419
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:15,886
I just see yours.

420
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:16,647
Hold on.

421
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:18,036
There's some here.

422
00:28:18,056 --> 00:28:18,717
Here.

423
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:25,648
That's it?

424
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:26,710
I think so.

425
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,411
Oh, there's a bee.

426
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,716
Oh.

427
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:31,157
Yep.

428
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:31,978
This is a tiny one.

429
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:34,482
Maybe there.

430
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:38,068
One right here.

431
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:41,934
Just a tiny one.

432
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:42,174
Okay.

433
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:43,917
So A.

434
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:49,585
B. C is plantain.

435
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,508
So this is plantain.

436
00:28:51,528 --> 00:29:09,516
So C, C, C, C, C. Did you get this?

437
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,180
in a second.

438
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:11,301
Okay.

439
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:12,722
Moving in that direction.

440
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:13,063
Okay.

441
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,585
Would you say this is the same?

442
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:16,808
It is smaller.

443
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,451
Wasn't that self-heal?

444
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,014
What's our letter self-heal?

445
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:24,438
So that's F of what?

446
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,623
We had self-heal as D previously.

447
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,906
F of D. F of D!

448
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:36,373
And then there's a nice big C here.

449
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,035
I guess that's kind of here.

450
00:29:38,453 --> 00:29:40,235
Yeah, on the border of the moss.

451
00:29:40,355 --> 00:29:40,655
Here.

452
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:44,479
Was this self-heal too?

453
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:52,067
So F of D. F of D. And that's self-heal.

454
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:57,132
F of D. Plantain over there, right?

455
00:29:57,352 --> 00:30:04,139
So that's C. Moving back across.

456
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,583
Plantain here.

457
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:22,423
I'm only writing self-heal because it's similar to... That be self-heal?

458
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:27,551
And do they compete?

459
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:34,363
And there's a sea there.

460
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:52,468
Okay.

461
00:30:52,488 --> 00:30:57,295
Do you want to do flat branching?

462
00:30:57,395 --> 00:30:59,038
Oh, is that the crabgrass?

463
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:00,620
Do we have any crabgrass?

464
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,621
We shouldn't have.

465
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:02,483
I didn't write that down.

466
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:05,447
Is this crabgrass?

467
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:08,432
We may not have grabbed it initially.

468
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,214
This one?

469
00:31:10,254 --> 00:31:14,020
Yeah, let's see.

470
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:29,500
I mean, it would be logical for us to have crabgrass.

471
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,501
We have bluegrass.

472
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:43,053
I don't see crabgrass in ours.

473
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:44,715
So we'll leave that one out.

474
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:46,649
Our broad one is bluegrass.

475
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,892
Our broad one is bluegrass?

476
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:51,033
Yeah.

477
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:55,097
Our broad grass is bluegrass.

478
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:02,104
And bear sedge.

479
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:04,546
And whatever this is.

480
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:08,410
Japanese stiltgrass.

481
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:12,174
So we have grasses, but we don't have crabgrass.

482
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,196
So we can't mark that one.

483
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,084
E was the sedge.

484
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:22,407
Do you want to draw on the sedge?

485
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,352
How are we going to... E?

486
00:32:26,392 --> 00:32:26,872
I can do it.

487
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:29,856
So yeah, E's are like around here.

488
00:32:29,876 --> 00:32:37,785
E, E. There's a lot of... So this is the sedge?

489
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:44,132
Yes.

490
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:46,536
There's a little E there.

491
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:47,958
There's some here.

492
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,541
You got these already.

493
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:04,939
Okay.

494
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,721
Really we don't have that much more.

495
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:07,702
It's in the sunny area.

496
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,284
What did you list as D?

497
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:10,686
Do we even have D?

498
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:13,950
That's the one we didn't have, right?

499
00:33:15,382 --> 00:33:23,373
Because we had a lot of the F. D was the crabgrass, which we didn't have.

500
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,935
Okay.

501
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:27,098
E was the sedge.

502
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,660
F is other.

503
00:33:29,121 --> 00:33:33,447
Yep.

504
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:36,331
So, which one was our stiltgrass?

505
00:33:37,993 --> 00:33:39,535
Stiltgrass.

506
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:39,996
F of what?

507
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:41,298
So this is stiltgrass.

508
00:33:41,338 --> 00:33:43,060
What did you give it as a letter?

509
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:44,722
From the previous one?

510
00:33:44,883 --> 00:33:45,203
Yeah.

511
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:46,843
Japanese soul.

512
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:49,706
That was C, previously.

513
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:54,110
So that's C there, and a lot up at the top.

514
00:34:10,946 --> 00:34:11,967
What did we call our bread?

515
00:34:12,027 --> 00:34:15,831
We had bluegrass, so what was our letter for bluegrass?

516
00:34:19,507 --> 00:34:22,551
Do we have bluegrass?

517
00:34:23,973 --> 00:34:25,416
Mm-hmm.

518
00:34:25,436 --> 00:34:26,537
Might have been one of our bottoms.

519
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:33,167
That was probably the last one you mentioned and I didn't get to write it down.

520
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:34,188
So N?

521
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,914
Okay, yep.

522
00:34:37,934 --> 00:34:38,815
F of N.

523
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:57,048
What was strawberry?

524
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,551
Mock strawberry?

525
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:01,373
Did you get it?

526
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:03,937
I. I?

527
00:35:04,337 --> 00:35:07,782
Yeah.

528
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:11,367
F of I. F of I. We have a lot of strawberry.

529
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:26,822
