00:01:03.447 --> 00:01:19.090
She told me you had a bear sighting!

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.452
Oh my god!

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:21.854
Little finger!

00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:25.560
Bear!

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.721
No, he said bye.

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:27.603
Bye!

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:29.465
He said bye.

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.328
That's great!

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:33.937
I was on the wall.

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:36.139
She did not want to see me.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.083
She wanted to see the bear.

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:40.725
She just kept asking for the bear.

00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:42.547
Wow!

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:45.651
They were climbing the trees.

00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:51.538
He's like, wow!

00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:56.944
That's so amazing.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:59.818
That's awesome.

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:03.122
What a cool experience.

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:06.907
I saw one mama bear and two baby bears.

00:02:06.927 --> 00:02:08.989
It makes me really happy because I see them every day.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.074
Which is kind of scary when we're... Sure, yeah.

00:02:13.094 --> 00:02:22.025
Yesterday morning, my mom and dad took on it and it needed a little return.

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:24.889
That's so cool.

00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:37.245
I'm not crazy.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:45.220
I mean like Lincoln right here.

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.704
It was on the side side of button

00:02:47.988 --> 00:02:48.809
This one?

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:49.771
Should I turn it off?

00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.313
I might have turned it off.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:53.316
So I guess the blinker that means it's on then, right?

00:02:53.577 --> 00:02:56.361
And then click the record button.

00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:56.601
OK.

00:02:56.882 --> 00:02:57.142
You're in.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:02:59.125
So we're good then.

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.207
It wasn't on.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.312
So why is yours doing?

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:05.355
Because this might not have as much battery.

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:06.908
No, his was on.

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.674
So welcome back y'all to this other side of the valley.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:17.098
So the West Crown Trail yesterday we had the chance to explore up towards the cemetery.

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:23.364
We're going to end at the cemetery today where we'll do a little loop on our hike.

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:35.376
And during our little hike we are going to have the chance to put on our learner hat one more time and practice a strategy and activity that we love here.

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.275
that also we've heard from a lot of educators is really applicable across grade levels and content areas.

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:45.320
We've heard lots of creative ways that this is being used.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.003
It's an activity called Each To Teach To.

00:03:49.264 --> 00:04:04.401
And this morning I was really thinking about Each To Teach To when John read the quote at breakfast by Rachel Carson, where she talks about how knowing is not half as important as loving.

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:13.767
And each to teach you gives us the space to really love and connect with this place or the place where you find yourself in.

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:19.393
and it gives you that chance to connect and maybe in a little bit new or different way.

00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:30.272
Yesterday we connected with salamanders and salamanders are so cute and they have the littlest tiniest toes and something full of black toe pads and like it's like love at first sight with a salamander.

00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:39.788
But when you're in the woods or you're in your neighborhood or you're in a park we might not connect with everything as quickly or as deeply as the face or the toes of a salamander.

00:04:40.814 --> 00:04:51.253
But each teacher gives us a lens to start to think about that connection, to see our place in maybe a little bit different way.

00:04:51.273 --> 00:04:59.929
And oftentimes when we are doing science, we think about the so what.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.037
We're just the welcome home committee.

00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:16.290
Can you tell it's a group of teachers?

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.374
Woohoo!

00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:22.578
Teachers!

00:05:22.598 --> 00:05:23.820
Spirit Fingers, part two.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.763
She said she's a retired teacher!

00:05:28.046 --> 00:05:32.672
I don't think when I, during the time I was here.

00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:34.755
What did you teach?

00:05:34.775 --> 00:05:36.758
First, third, fourth, seventh,

00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:38.256
All of the above.

00:05:38.277 --> 00:05:40.280
All of the above, yeah.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.924
Mostly science stuff here.

00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:43.827
Mostly science stuff.

00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:45.210
Science, STEM.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.474
I went to middle school and high school.

00:05:47.675 --> 00:05:48.316
Yep.

00:05:48.737 --> 00:05:49.679
There is no pension.

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.787
All right.

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:53.887
Woo!

00:05:53.907 --> 00:05:53.987
Woo!

00:05:56.397 --> 00:06:07.977
She set this up!

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:16.431
More teachers!

00:06:17.862 --> 00:06:28.211
So oftentimes this week we are really focused on data collection, thinking about this probabilistic thinking and revising our thinking, collecting more data, adding to the story.

00:06:28.832 --> 00:06:33.956
And oftentimes we wait till the end of that process to think about the so what behind it.

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.478
So what, why are we even studying this?

00:06:36.498 --> 00:06:46.367
But making these connections helps us put that so what at the beginning to help frame and connect us to the work throughout the process instead of just at the end.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:49.599
So here's how each two teach to is going to work.

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:56.529
In just a minute we will all together as a group hike up to that junction where yesterday we veered off to the right up to the cemetery.

00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:06.465
The whole group is going to stay put at that spot and I as a lonesome hiker is going to head up the trail for a little bit.

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:09.872
And as I am hiking, I'm going to be looking for something cool.

00:07:10.373 --> 00:07:18.141
It could be a species, it could be a medicinal plant, it could be connecting with the sounds around us, it could be artistic.

00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:23.927
Something that stands out to me in the trail in that space.

00:07:23.947 --> 00:07:34.798
And after about two-ish minutes, Grayson is going to send the first two people up the trail.

00:07:35.825 --> 00:07:40.232
And those first partners, their job is to hike until you find me.

00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:51.831
When you find me, I am going to teach you about whatever thing I stopped to look at or connect with, and then that becomes your station.

00:07:51.851 --> 00:08:01.647
So then you and your partners stay put there, and you will then teach the subsequent partners whatever that thing was as they come through.

00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:13.001
You are all teachers, so whatever I teach you is one way to say it, but you might have a way to add to it, to give it a little flair, add a little creativity.

00:08:13.502 --> 00:08:19.315
So the way that you deliver and share that thing is up to you and your partner.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:29.901
So after about two more minutes Grayson will send the next pair.

00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:34.546
That pair will hike up the trail until they find the first pair.

00:08:34.566 --> 00:08:38.971
They will stop at that first pair and learn whatever the fact is from that pair.

00:08:40.312 --> 00:08:42.034
That first pair will stay put.

00:08:42.054 --> 00:08:45.758
The second pair keeps hiking until they find them.

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:48.960
and then I will teach them something at that spot.

00:08:49.441 --> 00:08:51.464
That will become their station.

00:08:51.484 --> 00:08:52.706
They make it their own.

00:08:52.726 --> 00:08:54.289
Think about how they want to share it.

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:55.110
They stay put.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.232
I keep hiking.

00:08:56.252 --> 00:08:58.977
Two minutes later Grayson sends the third pair.

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:02.703
That third pair stops at the first pair and learns.

00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:04.907
Stops the second pair and learns.

00:09:04.927 --> 00:09:06.329
Keeps hiking until they find me.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.336
I will teach them something or have them do some kind of activity.

00:09:10.356 --> 00:09:11.678
That becomes their series.

00:09:11.658 --> 00:09:18.688
So we are all zipped, unzipped along the trail.

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:20.090
Grayson's going to be last.

00:09:20.871 --> 00:09:26.199
So once everybody has their station, she will come to you and you can teach her your thing.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.607
When you see Grayson, you know at Jatston.

00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:33.689
After you teach her.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.856
And then she's going to kind of stay put and you will make your way through the stations ahead of you.

00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:41.518
You are then the participant.

00:09:41.538 --> 00:09:43.780
She will then come to the next station.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.721
They will teach her.

00:09:45.142 --> 00:09:46.403
Then they will keep walking.

00:09:47.084 --> 00:09:56.995
The next one, they will keep walking until we all zip back up into one group at the end where another junction is.

00:09:57.095 --> 00:09:59.738
What questions do we have about each two teach two?

00:10:01.388 --> 00:10:03.833
If it doesn't make sense yet, that's fine.

00:10:03.853 --> 00:10:06.338
It'll be very clear what you need to do one step at a time.

00:10:06.358 --> 00:10:08.242
It looks like a gallery wall.

00:10:08.262 --> 00:10:12.250
Similar to a gallery wall?

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:12.351
Yep.

00:10:12.371 --> 00:10:12.651
All right.

00:10:13.252 --> 00:10:18.163
So as I said in my instructions and as the name implies, you do need a partner for this activity.

00:10:18.223 --> 00:10:22.772
So if you'll take a moment, find one other person to work with and appear.

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:53.704
Yeah, I wear evidence.

00:10:53.954 --> 00:10:54.815
Perfect.

00:10:54.835 --> 00:10:55.837
He's an influencer.

00:10:56.158 --> 00:10:57.340
That's right.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.745
We're going to be famous.

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:04.291
Hopefully for good things.

00:11:04.892 --> 00:11:06.856
One way or another.

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:14.288
Two by two.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.093
Now we go now and then.

00:11:17.073 --> 00:11:21.959
Then at a certain point we'll stop and then she'll go up and then start.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.226
This is that part of teaching where everybody, you've given all the instructions and you thought it out really carefully.

00:11:28.027 --> 00:11:30.550
Somebody says, what are we doing?

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.412
Oh, you remember those days, don't you?

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:37.158
Just a little bit.

00:11:37.178 --> 00:11:38.560
I visited your school last month.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.161
Did you?

00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:40.522
Yeah, for the reunion.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:42.224
Oh, you had a district wide thing?

00:11:42.405 --> 00:11:44.187
Not district wide, we had a class reunion.

00:11:44.307 --> 00:11:45.088
Oh, which class?

00:11:45.188 --> 00:11:45.949
It was a roaring,

00:11:46.283 --> 00:11:46.804
20s.

00:11:47.244 --> 00:11:48.465
We're pouring 20s.

00:11:48.566 --> 00:11:49.266
All the 20s.

00:11:50.067 --> 00:11:51.048
Yeah, the 2000s.

00:11:51.068 --> 00:11:52.029
The 2003, 4, and 5.

00:11:52.149 --> 00:11:55.033
Those classes.

00:11:55.273 --> 00:11:56.995
All the people.

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:58.016
2003.

00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:01.760
Was that your group?

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.441
It was, sadly.

00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:04.944
I think that was my favorite.

00:12:04.984 --> 00:12:09.028
They were my favorite.

00:12:09.048 --> 00:12:14.494
I'm not supposed to have favorites, but y'all were it.

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:15.295
News to my ears.

00:12:15.275 --> 00:12:16.257
I'm just saying that.

00:12:16.437 --> 00:12:21.367
Alright, I'm going to start heading up the trail, and then Grayson will give the cue.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.890
I know, I've got to... Oh, she's coming.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.277
I understand now, okay?

00:12:26.297 --> 00:12:28.962
I thought we were going to the cemetery first.

00:12:28.982 --> 00:12:31.467
Oh, nope.

00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:33.030
We'll head there.

00:12:33.297 --> 00:12:42.932
Cemetery last is what I intend to do in general.

00:12:42.952 --> 00:12:44.033
So who's there that I know?

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:46.698
We had my brother came.

00:12:46.718 --> 00:12:51.365
He didn't come to the school part but he went to the other one to the later event.

00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:52.346
Justin Long.

00:12:52.406 --> 00:12:54.570
Jay Long, our head football coach.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.050
Yes.

00:12:55.271 --> 00:12:56.132
Isn't that so cool?

00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:56.533
It is.

00:12:56.553 --> 00:12:57.374
He does a great job.

00:12:57.394 --> 00:12:58.135
I think he does.

00:12:58.395 --> 00:12:59.077
I think he does.

00:12:59.217 --> 00:12:59.818
He is.

00:13:00.378 --> 00:13:01.440
Who else?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.141
You got a butterfly?

00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:03.263
Brandon Wilkerson.

00:13:03.463 --> 00:13:04.104
Come for a beetle.

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:05.546
Remember Brandon?

00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:06.868
Oh my gosh.

00:13:06.888 --> 00:13:07.970
Terry Porter.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.112
He didn't come.

00:13:09.412 --> 00:13:10.654
Tonio Myer didn't come in.

00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:11.896
Tonio.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.218
Not Thomas Moore.

00:13:13.238 --> 00:13:14.620
No, he works for Milwaukee Bucks.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.041
I know.

00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:17.725
Oh yeah, you know all these things.

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:21.951
I sort of lost touch with Thomas, but I have to, you know how Thomas is.

00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:24.415
