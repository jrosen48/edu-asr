WEBVTT

00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:09.065
We're all within our group back on the trail.

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:17.093
You heard that I am not outdoorsy, but I am a gardener.

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:19.096
Kind of crazy, isn't it?

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:22.259
But if you find your niche, you just start to roll with it.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.081
I'm no hiker, though.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.170
Hiking is not my life, but hiking is a great thing to do.

00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:35.100
Everyone can find small trails, short trails, or you can be a biker and bike on trails that are for bikes only.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.811
I think we're coming to our first checkpoint.

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:43.612
We have a traffic jam.

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:50.001
Always a traffic jam, that's what we're going to call it.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.572
We see more out here.

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:04.255
A lot of nice looking forestry.

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:09.920
That is definitely worth gandering at.

00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:13.683
We have a ride out tree trunk right here.

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:16.685
That has long since been gone.

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:21.349
We are now crossing up the rocks and going to our checkpoint.

00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:23.631
Reach.

00:01:23.992 --> 00:01:28.155
What do you guys see in this area that might have been different than your hike up?

00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.545
Is there anything else?

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:34.067
Berries.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:34.828
Okay, berries.

00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:36.289
Let's focus.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.234
We have this area of observation over here.

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:41.396
You can even see up there.

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:47.363
It continues on the sides, but we want you to focus on this little berry right here.

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:48.985
There's one there.

00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:53.891
And then you guys are going to try to notice the difference.

00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.254
It's got two.

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:57.315
Yes.

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:00.773
So what do you think is those two points?

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:01.795
Like what is it from?

00:02:02.897 --> 00:02:06.744
And what could possibly be unique about that berry besides the two points?

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:19.827
Well it could be from... What do fruit produce?

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:20.539
Seeds.

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.202
Okay, so how many seeds do you think might be inside?

00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:24.184
Two.

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:24.444
Two.

00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:26.227
Okay, and question?

00:02:26.547 --> 00:02:29.051
So how do you think it came to be that berry?

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.754
Like what would create that berry?

00:02:32.275 --> 00:02:33.817
Like how would it be reproduced?

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.261
With the egg and the sperm.

00:02:37.522 --> 00:02:39.085
A flower, okay.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:46.194
So if there's two seeds, double fertilization like two eggs and two sperm.

00:02:46.214 --> 00:02:46.675
So two

00:02:47.296 --> 00:03:09.237
two flowers yeah two flowers and you can taste it it's edible and it's just kind of like it tastes like air yeah you're not gonna get nutrients from it i've eaten them before i don't need to eat them again it tastes like um you can find the citrusy air taste the two seeds though they are two seeds yeah and you can like individually like pop it out immediately

00:03:09.217 --> 00:03:10.339
Yep.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.041
And it's called Partridge Berry.

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:13.223
Partridge Berry.

00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:16.046
So it looks like the next group's coming up.

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:17.609
That was all we had for you guys.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:18.750
Thank you so much.

00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:19.852
We loved it.

00:03:20.272 --> 00:03:21.414
Yes.

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:22.616
Do you all want this back?

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:23.256
There you go.

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:24.478
It's all yours.

00:03:24.578 --> 00:03:30.286
It's not snack time yet.

00:03:30.406 --> 00:03:31.107
Up the trail we go.

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:32.489
That was the first checkpoint.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.675
And as we walk, we're going to look at the

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.144
downhill, you can hear the river, the waterway.

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:46.991
I'm not going to walk that far down because I could topple and I don't have insurance that can cover all that.

00:03:48.172 --> 00:03:51.817
So we're going to continue to trek uphill with my partners.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:01.931
As you see over here, you see all the greenery that is being shown or being produced by nature.

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:06.257
We see some pine

00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:09.735
Can you say a pine tree or something close to that?

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:11.318
That is up here.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:24.018
That is not quite your Christmas tree, but you know, it could be something to take home if you so choose to.

00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:26.783
But you have to hike to get it.

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.211
We have this interesting tree right here.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.455
It looks like a twig, a tall twig.

00:04:37.658 --> 00:04:38.880
It strikes your imagination.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.722
Look at that imagination.

00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:40.002
Look at.

00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:50.742
Now we're getting to our second checkpoint as we cross the threshold of this trail.

00:04:59.438 --> 00:04:59.498
OK.

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:03.884
We need you to touch this leaf and tell us what you feel.

00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.647
It's a sensory station.

00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:07.128
Yes.

00:05:07.408 --> 00:05:07.889
Sensory station.

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:08.630
It's so soft.

00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:10.112
It is soft.

00:05:10.132 --> 00:05:11.594
It's like a silk blanket.

00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:12.375
There you go.

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.498
This is, there's so much better than the other group.

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:15.879
They're very indirect.

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:16.020
Yeah.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.882
They said it was a sensory.

00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:20.205
It's all about our delivery.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:21.907
But the underside is veiny.

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:23.209
Yeah.

00:05:25.752 --> 00:05:26.053
Okay.

00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:27.915
What kind of tree does it remind you of?

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:34.596
Reminds me of a maple.

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:35.697
I almost thought aloe.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.602
Oh, aloe's a good one.

00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:40.344
Because it's smooth.

00:05:40.905 --> 00:05:41.326
Yes.

00:05:41.426 --> 00:05:44.470
So you're right, maple, because it has these little guys.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.895
I said tulip poplar because I didn't see these by the way she was holding it.

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.583
So that's a very special leaf you want to know how to locate.

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:54.727
It is indeed a maple.

00:05:54.827 --> 00:05:56.169
It's a striped.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.532
And how do we know?

00:05:57.832 --> 00:06:03.201
Maple because on the bark there's these little stripe marks.

00:06:03.221 --> 00:06:09.512
And so it is a safe leaf that you need if you are in need.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.881
It's the Charmin of the Woods.

00:06:13.183 --> 00:06:14.185
Charmin of the Woods.

00:06:14.225 --> 00:06:15.367
That's why you guys did so great.

00:06:15.387 --> 00:06:15.968
For the toiletries.

00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:22.318
You totally picked up on the fact that it was totally safe.

00:06:22.778 --> 00:06:24.200
Excellent, excellent job.

00:06:24.421 --> 00:06:25.983
And the Charmin is free.

00:06:26.043 --> 00:06:27.566
The Charmin is free.

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.328
The Charmin is free.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.053
I'm all sweaty.

00:06:33.114 --> 00:06:36.259
Nobody in there.

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:40.803
So we just found some Charmin in the forest.

00:06:43.145 --> 00:06:44.066
It cost you nothing.

00:06:45.568 --> 00:06:47.910
Just make sure you have some hand sanitizer afterwards.

00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:54.896
Or maybe even some hand wipes, you know, to wipe it.

00:06:55.157 --> 00:06:56.017
Maybe a little shovel.

00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:56.978
A little shovel too.

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:03.124
So you can distance yourself from the scent both

00:07:05.618 --> 00:07:27.154
never mind cut edit restart you see where this fell down yeah and all this is new like all this is all this quick growing that has popped up yeah

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.416
Just because it topples is that does not mean it will not be an asset to nature.

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.116
That's right.

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.641
All these these become nurse logs.

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:40.383
Mm hmm.

00:07:40.403 --> 00:07:40.924
You get stuck.

00:07:41.164 --> 00:07:41.905
They're already doing it.

00:07:41.925 --> 00:07:44.688
They've already got mushrooms all over.

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:57.023
My father in law is 60 and he was tied up with an extension

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.326
We're coming to our third checkpoint, I do believe.

00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:06.914
After we looked at this nice set of toppled trees and whatnot.

00:08:07.035 --> 00:08:11.921
Lots of downed trees.

00:08:13.863 --> 00:08:16.907
These are really big leaves.

00:08:16.927 --> 00:08:19.069
Why would a plant have really big leaves?

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:20.051
To get more sun.

00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:26.098
Maybe because it's diffused light and it has to spread itself out to get light.

00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:40.324
And like the stems are not woody and kind of light so they're probably quick to grow, fast to grow.

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:46.152
So we've got some other plants that there are a lot of.

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:49.477
Could it not also be a... Mushrooms are not plants.

00:08:49.537 --> 00:08:53.242
They're actually a... Fungus.

00:08:53.302 --> 00:08:55.565
A heterotroph as opposed to an autotroph.

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:55.685
Okay.

00:08:55.705 --> 00:08:58.549
We're more closely related to fungi than plants are.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:01.784
Wouldn't these plants serve as food for animals, too?

00:09:01.804 --> 00:09:02.846
They would, for sure.

00:09:03.527 --> 00:09:07.012
But we've got a lot of one type of plant growing in this area.

00:09:07.854 --> 00:09:09.637
These little hourglassy things?

00:09:09.657 --> 00:09:11.219
Yeah, these little hourglassy things.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.905
That's a tulip poplar.

00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:17.750
A tulip poplar, which is also apparently the state tree of Tennessee.

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.272
Did not know that.

00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:23.980
I think I've been told that before.

00:09:24.652 --> 00:09:25.553
And they get big.

00:09:25.593 --> 00:09:26.414
They get huge.

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:26.894
They do.

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:28.476
There's actually a few of them right over there.

00:09:28.676 --> 00:09:32.040
I believe that's one right behind Jen.

00:09:39.047 --> 00:09:50.659
They are early on the succession list because they are fast growing with those nice broad leaves for lots of energy harnessing.

00:09:52.715 --> 00:10:19.667
energy or sorry photosynthetic energy is uh they're very good at harvesting photosynthetic energy because of their large leaves there we go yes there's a coherent thought you hear that camera thank you a really big one of those things that we yeah those are the broadleaf plantain thank you appreciation

00:10:23.005 --> 00:10:23.726
Do you know that bird?

00:10:24.747 --> 00:10:25.627
I do not know that bird.

00:10:26.328 --> 00:10:28.290
It's the loudest bird in the forest.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.971
The Carolina Wren.

00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:30.372
It's a what again?

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:31.493
Carolina Wren.

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:33.114
Oh, a Carolina Wren.

00:10:33.215 --> 00:10:37.759
I call it the loudest bird in the forest because it is.

00:10:37.939 --> 00:10:38.359
Look how little.

00:10:43.324 --> 00:10:43.404
Hmm.

00:10:43.424 --> 00:10:44.445
Making that big old noise.

00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:49.890
Had some big lungs, I guess, that we can't see something.

00:10:54.764 --> 00:11:16.791
So this section of the trail, what sort of new thing caught your eye as you were walking up?

00:11:16.831 --> 00:11:18.373
Like a little white mushroom.

00:11:19.775 --> 00:11:20.676
That's the thing.

00:11:20.716 --> 00:11:21.497
Okay.

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:38.558
so we were tasked with having you guys find the beginning middle and end of the life cycle of this mushroom yeah okay and you find it in three different cycles if it's fruiting life so

00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:46.176
Some of them are round and closed and some of them are open.

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:48.380
Is the opening part a phase?

00:11:49.441 --> 00:11:50.783
Is that the final phase?

00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:52.126
Here's an open one.

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:54.530
This is closed and that one's open.

00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:58.276
Yeah, but then I think... There's a medium.

00:11:58.596 --> 00:12:01.561
Yeah, so that's the end phase and the closed is the beginning.

00:12:01.581 --> 00:12:04.005
What do you think the middle phase would look like then?

00:12:06.652 --> 00:12:31.748
a little bit open yeah say it again this is the middle stage no this is the beginning beginning and then that's the end more like the end phases what would be the middle phase like this one right here with a little open i think that's a bug hole i think

00:12:32.285 --> 00:12:32.726
A what?

00:12:32.886 --> 00:12:33.347
A buckle?

00:12:33.647 --> 00:12:35.230
A bug hole?

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.174
You know bug holes?

00:12:38.815 --> 00:12:39.917
You know bug holes?

00:12:40.097 --> 00:12:41.940
They're like muggles except bugles.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.062
I thought you said buckle.

00:12:43.202 --> 00:12:44.304
In the bug hole.

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:45.766
The bug hole?

00:12:45.986 --> 00:12:46.567
No.

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:48.610
I don't see one.

00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:50.293
Do you see one that's different than those?

00:12:51.505 --> 00:12:56.092
So I kind of feel like this one is a middle phase.

00:12:56.113 --> 00:12:58.797
See how it's kind of starting to go a little more translucent.

00:12:59.218 --> 00:13:01.421
Oh and it's not quite as open.

00:13:01.621 --> 00:13:03.384
It doesn't have those ruffly edges.

00:13:03.725 --> 00:13:04.065
Right.

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:06.109
Cool.

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:14.222
And then we were also asked as you were looking what's one unique thing about this mushroom than other mushrooms you observed.

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:21.817
Where is it growing as grouped together as some?

00:13:21.837 --> 00:13:28.926
Okay, so more individual, not quite as clustered.

00:13:29.006 --> 00:13:35.214
Isn't this a small cluster right here of them?

00:13:36.475 --> 00:13:37.296
You may pass.

00:13:37.396 --> 00:13:42.543
That's where I discovered them.

00:13:42.683 --> 00:13:45.306
They look thinner too.

00:13:45.826 --> 00:13:48.390
Well, looks like they're small clusters, though, like here.

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:48.951
Yeah.

00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:49.471
Mm hmm.

00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:53.257
Fascinating.

00:13:53.397 --> 00:13:54.058
Thank you all.

00:13:54.138 --> 00:13:55.059
Thank you for the lesson.

00:14:01.649 --> 00:14:04.073
So that was checkpoint, I think, three or four.

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.775
I'm starting to lose count.

00:14:06.228 --> 00:14:06.989
but it's all good.

00:14:07.089 --> 00:14:27.711
But we just learned about some mushrooms and the stages at what, uh, what they're in stage one, stage two or stage three and how they look at each stage, which is very interesting and mind boggling at the same time.

00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.834
Ooh, look all the campground down there.

00:14:31.015 --> 00:14:32.016
That's what that is.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:43.371
There's a campground down there, it looks like, where you can put a tent up and enjoy safely, of course.

00:14:45.194 --> 00:14:47.317
Oh, let me catch up.

00:15:01.156 --> 00:15:01.497
All right, y'all.

00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:01.637
Hello.

00:15:01.657 --> 00:15:01.777
Hello.

00:15:01.797 --> 00:15:01.917
Hello.

00:15:01.937 --> 00:15:02.458
Your station in this city.

00:15:04.565 --> 00:15:33.508
you are going to be sharing with lots of ferns around you're going to be sharing about this particular fern right here if you already know it hold it hold your tongue um what do you all notice about this fern there's some here you can look at it you can feel it pay particular attention to the shape that's a different one that's the kind that she's looking at right there

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:34.951
See the difference here?

00:15:35.411 --> 00:15:35.812
I do.

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:49.306
If you were a scientist and you were already given a scientific name but you were charged with giving it a common name, what would you name this fern and why?

00:15:55.453 --> 00:15:59.056
I might name it something having to do with a comb because it looks like a comb to me.

00:15:59.517 --> 00:16:02.500
Okay, the comb fern.

00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:30.850
um it almost looks like a tree like some of the shapes it is something like a tree i don't know what its actual common name is given to by some random person so the actual common name of this fern is the christmas fern so on to your point some people are like oh it looks like a christmas tree yeah another reason i've heard is that if you turn the fern horizontally

00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:37.884
that the little leaves look like stockings hanging from the mantle on a fireplace.

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:50.425
So your task is to have people notice, wonder about the fern, give it their own common name, and then you can share its real name and a little bit about the history of, well, one reason why.

00:16:50.523 --> 00:17:15.771
all right have fun make it your own there's also just i just noticed there's also about a year a skinny yearling bear right down there he's just drinking at the stream he's in the trees oh yeah it's like a big dog is it coming up here

00:17:16.308 --> 00:17:21.876
Do we have a dog, a bow horn?

00:17:22.297 --> 00:17:38.400
He's not going to want to have anything to do with us if we make a lot of noise.

00:21:41.195 --> 00:21:50.627
Hey, Bear.

00:21:50.667 --> 00:21:53.230
You're beautiful.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:53.771
Go away.

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:00.560
Go on now.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.241
We love you.

00:22:01.301 --> 00:22:04.044
Stay away from people.

00:22:04.064 --> 00:22:05.486
Good choices.

00:22:07.448 --> 00:22:08.670
Good choices.

00:22:12.785 --> 00:22:37.022
I didn't see you there.

00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:37.543
Come on now, we love you.

00:22:44.813 --> 00:22:47.716
Okay, wow.

00:22:49.317 --> 00:22:50.879
All right, I forgot I had my binoculars.

00:22:50.899 --> 00:22:52.700
I've got my binoculars right here.

00:22:53.061 --> 00:22:53.942
This is not my station.

00:22:53.962 --> 00:23:01.609
If you can just keep an eye and make sure they don't come back this way, then people can look at it as they are coming up the trail too.

00:23:10.157 --> 00:23:14.601
If it starts coming up the hill, we're going to yell at it to go away.

00:23:15.475 --> 00:23:22.763
So I guess we taught our lesson, didn't we?

00:23:22.883 --> 00:23:25.105
Who's ready for a fern lesson?

00:23:26.006 --> 00:23:26.587
Who's our group?

00:23:27.668 --> 00:23:28.469
We are.

00:23:28.489 --> 00:23:30.892
How old is that bear, though?

00:23:31.052 --> 00:23:32.113
A little bit, it's okay.

00:23:32.153 --> 00:23:32.694
Go for it.

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:34.316
Now do it.

00:23:34.776 --> 00:23:36.558
When do you get to be a fern?

00:23:36.598 --> 00:23:38.080
You can see ferns all the time.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.302
We'll teach you really quickly and then you can go.

00:23:53.647 --> 00:23:54.708
to it.

00:23:54.768 --> 00:23:55.389
But they do.

00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:59.835
But it's okay.

00:24:00.716 --> 00:24:09.747
Because we're protected.

00:24:11.209 --> 00:24:12.291
Maybe.

00:24:12.371 --> 00:24:17.317
It's the root dance.

00:24:17.437 --> 00:24:18.278
Exciting.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.922
Where's his mom?

00:24:20.982 --> 00:24:21.983
Where's his mom?

00:24:22.537 --> 00:24:25.588
Let's not figure that out.

00:24:25.648 --> 00:24:29.963
I just want to keep my eyes open, just in case.

00:24:31.829 --> 00:24:34.037
Would you all like a little lesson?

00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:34.639
Sure.

00:24:36.593 --> 00:24:37.514
Are you out of the first three?

00:24:37.534 --> 00:24:38.956
No, you're not.

00:24:38.976 --> 00:24:40.678
You don't know where to go, huh?

00:24:40.698 --> 00:24:42.240
No, not a long way.

00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:43.923
I don't know how long.

00:24:43.963 --> 00:24:46.226
So don't we teach them the lesson and they teach it to the next person?

00:24:46.766 --> 00:24:47.587
No, no, we stay here.

00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:52.153
And then we come up, they go on and we stay here.

00:24:53.895 --> 00:24:55.257
So we're looking at ferns.

00:24:56.198 --> 00:24:58.902
And there are a couple of ferns in this area.

00:25:00.424 --> 00:25:02.787
We're particularly looking for one that looks like this.

00:25:03.408 --> 00:25:07.934
Up here those are a little different you see the difference in them.

00:25:07.954 --> 00:25:22.192
Yeah, so if you were a scientist And you were gonna come up with a common name For that fern I want you to look at it and look at its characteristics and see if you can figure out What you might?

00:25:23.114 --> 00:25:24.415
Name it Christmas tree.

00:25:25.136 --> 00:25:27.319
Why do you say Christmas tree the shape?

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.343
And where do you see the shape like?

00:25:30.847 --> 00:25:43.978
in the overall strand that's what i was looking at or a fan or a palm oh feather palm that's a good one fan feather palm

00:25:44.262 --> 00:25:45.503
OK, those are both good.

00:25:46.164 --> 00:25:49.488
Do you know what that fern is actually called?

00:25:49.508 --> 00:25:52.431
I mean, I don't know the scientific names.

00:25:52.511 --> 00:25:54.133
Furnace, furnace.

00:25:54.153 --> 00:25:55.654
Yes, exactly.

00:25:56.135 --> 00:26:00.640
Many people call this a Christmas fern because of the reason you said.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:08.968
And also, some people think these little individual petals look like a stocking on the mantle.

00:26:09.008 --> 00:26:12.312
Nice.

00:26:12.832 --> 00:26:40.459
okay because like at the bottom there's a little there's a little heel in the bottom and so that's how i can tell them the difference between these two i don't know all the ferns but i know that one and there's another fern called a maiden hair fern where the ferns are like in a little wreath like a fairy might wear around her head so i can remember those easily well if you want to stay and bear you're welcome if you want to move on you're also welcome to do that

00:26:40.574 --> 00:26:42.638
The bear is totally this round.

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:44.421
I know, right?

00:26:44.942 --> 00:26:45.363
Yes.

00:26:45.624 --> 00:26:49.030
I figured we were that literally every one right here.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:53.198
I kind of think we was going to stay here by ourselves with this bear, but never mind.

00:26:53.619 --> 00:26:54.921
Ann would keep us safe.

00:26:56.032 --> 00:26:57.574
I love that you think that's true.

00:26:58.495 --> 00:27:00.978
All I know how to do is yell great things at the bear about itself.

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:02.560
That seemed to work.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.641
I learned that from the Rangers.

00:27:03.941 --> 00:27:05.964
You don't have to say terrible, horrible things in the bear.

00:27:06.284 --> 00:27:07.946
It can't speak English, it turns out.

00:27:08.687 --> 00:27:10.469
You just have to discourage it with noise.

00:27:10.509 --> 00:27:12.011
Turns out it doesn't know its name.

00:27:12.512 --> 00:27:15.736
No, it just needs to stay away from people.

00:27:15.756 --> 00:27:17.638
You see the bear stood there, isn't he?

00:27:17.658 --> 00:27:18.719
Still going away somewhere?

00:27:18.739 --> 00:27:21.102
I talked all night about him shutting up for the next two.

00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:22.123
OK.

00:27:22.764 --> 00:27:24.486
Well, there we learned that these two did.

00:27:24.803 --> 00:27:25.424
so they can go.

00:27:25.584 --> 00:27:27.928
It graduated.

00:27:28.188 --> 00:27:28.989
You have a degree.

00:27:31.734 --> 00:27:32.134
Hi guys.

00:27:32.154 --> 00:27:32.535
Hello.

00:27:32.655 --> 00:27:33.416
Ferns.

00:27:33.516 --> 00:27:33.957
Ferns.

00:27:34.017 --> 00:27:39.906
So, um, as you see these ferns, you see this one in particular.

00:27:40.687 --> 00:27:45.675
What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you see this beautiful fern?

00:27:46.035 --> 00:27:52.966
It's got these nice little ridges, sharp leaves.

00:27:53.006 --> 00:27:53.106
Okay.

00:27:54.082 --> 00:27:55.606
They arch.

00:27:55.626 --> 00:27:56.628
They arch, all right.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:05.028
So if they do those things, what would be the name that you would give it based on what you just said?

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:06.752
Just a common name.

00:28:06.772 --> 00:28:07.795
Doesn't have to be a Latin name.

00:28:07.815 --> 00:28:08.556
Like someone's teeth.

00:28:09.158 --> 00:28:10.661
Reminds me of sawtooth.

00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:12.225
Sawtooth fern?

00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:16.592
Jaws fern.

00:28:16.612 --> 00:28:17.173
Jaws fern.

00:28:18.114 --> 00:28:19.536
Do you guys have any names?

00:28:20.137 --> 00:28:21.358
Okay, looks like an arrow.

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:22.259
Arrow, yeah.

00:28:22.439 --> 00:28:22.940
Okay, arrow.

00:28:24.682 --> 00:28:27.105
Especially this big one right here.

00:28:27.125 --> 00:28:28.407
So can you tell that those are different?

00:28:28.467 --> 00:28:29.228
Yeah.

00:28:30.329 --> 00:28:32.071
Yeah, they're a different variety of fern.

00:28:32.932 --> 00:28:34.794
And we're wanting to focus on just this one.

00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:37.718
I mean, not that you were wrong, but like to notice the difference, right?

00:28:37.738 --> 00:28:40.221
They would have different names, right?

00:28:41.872 --> 00:28:43.114
Do you want to propose a name?

00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:44.858
Feather Fern.

00:28:44.878 --> 00:28:46.781
That's nice.

00:28:47.903 --> 00:28:48.284
Close.

00:28:48.565 --> 00:28:49.667
What is it?

00:28:49.787 --> 00:28:50.128
Bird.

00:28:52.151 --> 00:28:57.822
There's a holiday that you get out of school for a lot.

00:28:58.173 --> 00:28:59.515
It's kind of cold outside.

00:28:59.736 --> 00:29:01.098
There you go.

00:29:01.178 --> 00:29:02.059
Nice.

00:29:02.079 --> 00:29:03.201
Because it looks like a Christmas tree.

00:29:04.003 --> 00:29:04.223
Yes.

00:29:04.544 --> 00:29:08.390
And these individual leaves, some people say look like a stocking.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.151
I can see that.

00:29:10.193 --> 00:29:11.034
Like stockings.

00:29:11.054 --> 00:29:11.275
Yeah.

00:29:11.295 --> 00:29:14.139
Because it has a little heel on the bottom there.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.725
So it has like a Christmas vibe to it.

00:29:17.745 --> 00:29:19.048
It's kind of a Christmas vibe.

00:29:19.068 --> 00:29:19.789
Christmas in July.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:20.530
Yeah.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:21.071
That's right.

00:29:21.091 --> 00:29:21.512
Should we move?

00:29:21.532 --> 00:29:22.714
Thank you guys.

00:29:22.734 --> 00:29:23.435
So you have passed.

00:29:23.455 --> 00:29:24.737
You graduated.

00:29:25.156 --> 00:29:30.186
I still have John's binoculars, but he's chasing the bear.

00:29:30.286 --> 00:29:30.807
No camera?

00:29:31.028 --> 00:29:31.408
It died.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:32.230
Again.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.557
Sorry, we had some good blooper reels too.

00:29:35.737 --> 00:29:37.541
So you didn't get to capture the bear down there?

00:29:37.561 --> 00:29:37.921
No!

00:29:39.064 --> 00:29:39.304
Dang.

00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:39.705
Well I did.

00:29:39.837 --> 00:29:40.197
Good.

00:29:40.498 --> 00:29:41.118
Footage.

00:29:41.238 --> 00:29:46.244
Yes, I'm gonna sell it.

00:29:46.264 --> 00:29:49.207
$5 per second for narration.

00:29:51.249 --> 00:29:51.889
Well, come on up.

00:29:51.929 --> 00:29:54.352
We're looking at some ferns up here.

00:29:54.893 --> 00:30:02.801
There's a couple different kinds of ferns out in here, and we're kind of focusing on these right in here.

00:30:03.181 --> 00:30:08.967
So once you just take a look at them and see what kind of characteristics you see, how would you describe their leaves or their shape?

00:30:09.824 --> 00:30:10.525
Flat.

00:30:11.547 --> 00:30:15.192
Are they compound or simple?

00:30:15.212 --> 00:30:16.093
No, they've got to be.

00:30:18.857 --> 00:30:19.859
It's one stem.

00:30:21.261 --> 00:30:24.826
So it looks like it's a multi-stem plant.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.832
It's definitely got little serrated edges.

00:30:29.012 --> 00:30:29.453
Yeah.

00:30:29.872 --> 00:30:45.012
So if you're the science guy who finds these out in nature and it's your job to give it a common name, what are you going to name it?

00:30:46.696 --> 00:30:47.357
Pointy plant.

00:30:47.638 --> 00:30:51.263
Pointy plant.

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:55.130
It looks more like a... It reminds me of a feather.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.931
Yeah.

00:30:55.971 --> 00:30:59.336
But it's not soft, but it reminds me of the shape of a feather.

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:07.930
Well, they are actually called Christmas ferns.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:08.571
Oh, okay.

00:31:09.052 --> 00:31:09.733
Yes.

00:31:10.169 --> 00:31:18.286
can see kind of the shape of the Christmas tree but also some people think like if you turn it sideways it looks like little stockings hanging from the mantle.

00:31:19.308 --> 00:31:20.270
That's a stretch.

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:31.553
I mean maybe back in the days when people would hang socks like an actual sock rather than a stocking.

00:31:32.056 --> 00:31:57.338
yeah because socks tend to hang more straight the stocking really has the heel right yeah yeah yeah you have to think old school yeah and that's all we have to teach you today is it edible not that i'm aware of does it have a smooth side and a fuzzy side

00:31:57.318 --> 00:32:13.504
You prevented me from my dad joke, which is everything's edible once.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.802
Well, you all have graduated.

00:32:16.703 --> 00:32:32.503
We're going to have a bear delay is my prediction.

00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:33.724
Yes.

00:32:34.044 --> 00:32:40.773
It's going to be like 20 minutes before anyone else comes along.

00:32:40.793 --> 00:32:42.495
I need everybody to share all their
