1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,653
the production process.

2
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:10,064
I broke her zipper on the head of her hiking bag last year and she was so mad because I was like hungry and trying to get in there.

3
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:10,785
You were hungry.

4
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:12,928
Dude, I fixed it.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:18,015
You can go to a cobbler and they'll fix zippers for you.

6
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:23,181
That's cool.

7
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:23,962
I should talk to you later.

8
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:24,503
Is it head started?

9
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:27,119
Hit us with your best shot.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,124
And I really, I know we're taking you away from stuff and I really appreciate it.

11
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,308
It's like the stuff like this is what helps with the funding to help us to get to.

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,531
So we'll just go ahead and get started.

13
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:39,214
These are the post questions.

14
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:44,120
We're at the end of the focus group and we've got four questions.

15
00:00:44,721 --> 00:00:46,223
And if you're ready, we'll get started.

16
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:49,207
Okay.

17
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:53,292
And again, the same as what I said yesterday or when we were online,

18
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:54,437
It's going to be recorded.

19
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:55,760
We're going to save it on a drive.

20
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:58,306
It's voluntary.

21
00:00:58,567 --> 00:00:59,429
You don't want to answer anything.

22
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:00,230
You don't have to.

23
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:01,694
Dot, dot, dot.

24
00:01:01,714 --> 00:01:03,217
OK.

25
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:09,993
So looking back now, how has your understanding of place-based education changed or deepened since participating in Project Credible?

26
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:10,875
So this is in representation.

27
00:01:12,897 --> 00:01:41,858
the past few days not before the past few days yeah this is just how has it changed since our pre focus group and now were you able to participate in the free in the free one kind of kind of okay so this is okay yeah thanks yeah okay okay all right we repeat the question now that we're on the same page yeah

28
00:01:42,023 --> 00:01:49,010
So looking back now, how has your understanding of place-based education changed or deepened?

29
00:01:49,030 --> 00:02:02,905
I feel like I've gotten a lot of ideas from the Tremont folks about how to make some more open-ended ideas to invite the kids to connect with their place, wherever they are.

30
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:09,110
We had some ideas already using the Level Up Challenge, sound mapping.

31
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,663
They just so.

32
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,798
I think I've truly benefited.

33
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:14,878
As.

34
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,310
Becoming in as teacher leaders already knowing what.

35
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:19,354
The.

36
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,811
not the whole end goal, but having an idea of the end goal.

37
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:36,270
I think I've mostly benefited from the people that are here learning beside us, because we have to keep it in mind that we're all at different points through this process.

38
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:42,639
And some of their fresh insights, I like thinking about where does that fit in the whole cycle of things.

39
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:48,868
So I think that's kind of helped me think more about like place-based and using

40
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:56,988
how do we connect what we've done in the past to where we're going.

41
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:13,995
I don't know if there's anything new, but yeah, I think I've gotten a lot out of the collaboration part and it might even be something I do already, but this person has a different nuanced way of doing it that I've benefited from.

42
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:39,443
The other part is being the teacher leaders and being middle school and high school, doing a similar biodiversity plot, because I've done the hula hoops before, but then seeing it done on a middle school or a high school level with the Simpsons index, and then going back just now and seeing how we can even incorporate some of that and adding a few more layers

43
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:56,571
You got anything, Mike?

44
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:16,834
I think being here, kind of immersing ourselves in both connecting to this place by just exploring it and using a lot of ways in which we can explore through tactically and listening and using our senses.

45
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:21,579
And then also the collaboration piece, being immersed with people

46
00:04:22,268 --> 00:04:48,597
I think Jen and I, we were just talking about like how this is different from like some of the other PDs we've been to and how, I don't know, like how like more productive it kind of is set up like in a multiple day immersive experience because like we're really gonna know one another but also like

47
00:04:48,830 --> 00:05:18,634
we plan on using it and I think intentions like with a day PD is to use it but there's like there's not a lot of time to reverse and like like being here away from home leaves us like without some of those other duties that may take up more of our time and space in our head you know when we're planning so yeah I think I realized like how unimportant names are while being here

48
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:23,003
and thinking like I've always kind of like said that but like I always want to know the name.

49
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:27,190
But now I'm just thinking like when I introduce myself to people I'm not even gonna say my name.

50
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,274
You're not gonna get my name, you'll get it later.

51
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:43,778
And I hear a lot of it's about like being able to collaborate into work and we've learned a lot of new kind of techniques and ways to deepen our stuff, yeah.

52
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:50,310
How is your thinking or comfort level with teaching data literacy or working with data evolved during this PD?

53
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,635
I think that it's less daunting.

54
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:12,670
And I think that was a big goal was to try and make it less daunting and let the tools kind of do the work for us and also realizing that data isn't just spreadsheets.

55
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,090
I think that's good.

56
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:21,669
I don't know.

57
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:35,064
Yeah, like I think a lot of conversation we've had about data as it's come up has been really enlightening.

58
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:43,093
Like really giving more weight to qualitative data too.

59
00:06:43,681 --> 00:07:04,272
So I think yeah like and the guidance of some of the data science folks at UT has really like they've asked the questions that like kind of opened my mind up to like thinking about data being like way more broad than the narrow kind of perspective I had before.

60
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:18,384
And it's a little dry and boring.

61
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:22,088
And I think the way, I mean, that's my perception.

62
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:23,870
I think that's probably your bias.

63
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,953
That's definitely my bias.

64
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:39,068
And I think being here and seeing it done in a different light, like I know some of these trees, I mean, I've done been with Tremont for awhile, so.

65
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:45,420
But having that side-by-side data collection and graphing, I think that is different and new.

66
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:57,291
And it makes it less daunting and then also gives more of a relationship to these numbers in a more concrete way instead of just this abstract idea that we're supposed to be doing it.

67
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:06,740
But I think this weekend has really reinforced multiple times throughout all the sessions about, OK, how are we going to get kids to care and relate to it?

68
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,983
We've seen this done so many times this week.

69
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:19,928
That's been beneficial for me.

70
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:24,878
Can you share any ways you plan to use what you've learned here in your teaching?

71
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:26,200
So anything specific?

72
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:38,922
I think that CodeApp is way more, like when I first used it like five or six years ago, I liked it okay, but I think it's way more, it has a lot more useful tools now.

73
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:53,276
And I still like data classroom, but I think that CodeApp might be a little bit more for my ESS kids and still being able to create those good graphs with those standard deviation bars and all that.

74
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,798
So that was one for me.

75
00:09:03,203 --> 00:09:12,495
to end up taking that, because I can see my standards, my sixth grade standards, turn into your ESS standards.

76
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:18,683
And like hearing that there's a wildlife, that's crazy.

77
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,907
And my kids could take a wildlife.

78
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:24,670
It's really helped my kids.

79
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:29,316
What could they do instead of like, I know they can do this, what could they do?

80
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,898
Like how could we expand this a little bit?

81
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:40,396
And I like that you said that too because a lot of times, we've talked to lots of students in the past and we've mentioned it here is that students are like, well, I don't like science.

82
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:42,781
And we're like, where did that disconnect go?

83
00:09:43,122 --> 00:09:46,508
And so trying to catch that along the way is good.

84
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:57,261
And working on these standards that we plan to teach, I know we will do that.

85
00:09:58,103 --> 00:09:58,805
And I work with them.

86
00:09:58,825 --> 00:09:59,847
They're in the same building.

87
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:02,453
And we've had three days to hash out ideas.

88
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:10,251
And then referencing back to the BD thing, what BD have we ever had?

89
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:44,608
call Josh so he can make that data set for us if we really need it or when hearing you say like we talked this morning when we're looking at the leaves and hearing Whitaker say my seventh graders don't know what a heterotrope is and hearing you say my eighth graders don't know what a heterotrope is okay well I taught them that in sixth grade and Allie taught them that in seventh grade so how do they get to eighth grade and they still don't know that obviously speaks

90
00:10:45,112 --> 00:11:01,197
So that hearing that hearing John talk about that really shifted my life Oh change here if you can learn this for three straight years and still get to eighth grade and

91
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:16,104
We're really saying it two times because they don't really have to use that language in eighth grade.

92
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:19,449
They're only saying it two times in their entire experience.

93
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,291
That's not enough.

94
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,914
That language needs to be throughout.

95
00:11:22,954 --> 00:11:25,978
You're really going to learn that scientific language.

96
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:37,815
They need to have something confident attached to it and use it their own selves instead of just us telling them.

97
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:39,530
I don't know what else to add.

98
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,774
I think the motivation piece is pretty big.

99
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:51,324
I think I'm gonna start off with some sensory stuff this year.

100
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,550
What were you gonna say?

101
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:05,440
No, I think the sensory and then like the language and immersing them in visuals and hands-on versus

102
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,710
this is what it is, and this is what it is.

103
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:14,461
And I think you already do that with all of your observation and everything at the beginning.

104
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:19,028
So I think this might just enhance that more, because I think you already do it.

105
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:29,325
Actually, I've been talking to Josh more about incorporating secondary data yesterday morning after we were talking, and then we were sitting together.

106
00:12:30,026 --> 00:12:31,849
And I think that's something I want to

107
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:36,026
focus more on, too, is how to find data so that I can use it.

108
00:12:36,447 --> 00:12:40,211
When we're looking at iNaturals, how do I get this longitude latitude thing to work out?

109
00:12:42,353 --> 00:12:49,100
So I think that's something that maybe I won't use, I plan to use in my classroom, but it's really kind of motivating me to learn more about.

110
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:55,627
Because it is not easy to find data across different sources even.

111
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,230
Good data.

112
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,954
Even though there's so much available,

113
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,365
Yeah, right?

114
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:17,621
I think part of that too is like, it's like every disciplinary area speaks a different language in every computer system, you know, so it's not this nice user friendly kind of wading through the weeds.

115
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,923
Yeah, find what works.

116
00:13:20,245 --> 00:13:26,714
And this connects to this like, and I think we've already said a lot about what were your biggest takeaways from this specific professional development.

117
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:30,199
You all have talked a lot about that interwoven with the other questions.

118
00:13:30,359 --> 00:13:31,941
Is there anything you want to add about that?

119
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:37,783
Any takeaways from the whole thing, which she said we already did.

120
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:41,688
Anything you wanna add?

121
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,872
I just think it's so important to have time to do this.

122
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:48,897
And I know it takes money, and that's why our district doesn't do it.

123
00:13:49,017 --> 00:13:53,402
But I think what I could say is our district does not do a good job of this, right?

124
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:54,604
And we need it.

125
00:13:55,104 --> 00:14:02,333
Especially with these upper-level standards and the conceptual connection between them all, it's hard to do that.

126
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:23,084
without really, maybe you were exposed to it in a mathematics class in college like 30 years ago, but it's really tough to learn when you don't know stuff, and I think this has given me the opportunity to know stuff and design really well things and have support while doing it, so it's not just me in the dark.

127
00:14:23,785 --> 00:14:25,888
And I feel a lot of the cohort kind of feels that same way.

128
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,110
Yeah.

129
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,113
Totally, and that collaborative piece, and yeah.

130
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:32,726
and just being able to actually take the time to do it, yeah.

131
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:35,729
Because our district, yeah, they don't do the things.

132
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:39,111
And you guys write grants all the time and all that just to be able to do things.

133
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:44,596
And without it, then we just do the best we can.

134
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:45,057
Yeah.

135
00:14:45,077 --> 00:14:49,721
I think there's a lot of that feeling I have is just like, well, I'm just going to do it day by day.

136
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:51,242
What I can is what I can.

137
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,004
And it's left at that.

138
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:58,088
And so having a more intentional PD like this where we're financially

139
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:28,500
But that's it's like we got here already with the mindset of like we want to make something happen this school year The only complaint I've heard is I'm tired and hot there's been nothing else.

140
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:29,782
Yeah, that's beautiful.

141
00:15:30,143 --> 00:15:33,627
Yeah like

142
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:41,994
I think that speaks to like really targeting certain teachers too that would be receptive to this and trying to win them over first.

143
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,056
Through the project.

144
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:43,917
Yeah.

145
00:15:44,018 --> 00:15:45,861
Through the teacher leaders.

146
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:55,497
Yeah, like maybe that's something we could do is like when we go DLD day, target certain people we see in some of these sessions and be like, well, you seem like you'd be down with us, right?

147
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:57,019
And that you're open to learning.

148
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,884
That's what I said to the person that we were out here too is,

149
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:01,085
And I said, you're open to it.

150
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,747
That's why you're here, you know?

151
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:05,990
And we don't wanna just hear the excuses all the time.

152
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:07,552
Just do it.

153
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:15,680
Well, maybe John was experiencing something.

154
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,063
Maybe delete that from the tape.

155
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,144
No, we're good.

156
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:23,528
I think it's just positive all around and it's just been good.

157
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:26,671
Well, that's it.

158
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:27,452
Thank you.

159
00:16:27,532 --> 00:16:28,072
Any questions?

160
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:28,833
Thank you.

161
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:29,854
Let me know.

162
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:31,569
What kind of chips we got?

163
00:16:31,609 --> 00:16:33,034
We got those hot and hotter.

164
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:34,438
You liked those ones.

165
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:35,783
Yeah, the zappos.

166
00:16:35,803 --> 00:16:39,996
Yeah, I want that mild.
