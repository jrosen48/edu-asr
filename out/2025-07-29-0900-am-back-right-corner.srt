1
00:00:54,166 --> 00:01:10,764
In terms of data, firsthand data, how would you use those?

2
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:11,866
Well, like we said, the place is where you are, right?

3
00:01:11,886 --> 00:01:12,748
So place-based data or place-based lessons.

4
00:01:38,682 --> 00:02:03,137
Those are things we can find out.

5
00:02:25,342 --> 00:02:28,045
Ooh.

6
00:04:28,225 --> 00:04:31,249
using the language of probability.

7
00:10:51,355 --> 00:11:04,857
I was just gonna ask what is Spell Bayesian you keep using that word over and over and over.

8
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,723
What is it like B IZ or B?

9
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:48,644
Okay.

10
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:49,045
Thank you.

11
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,018
I totally had that spelled wrong.

12
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:57,492
Yeah, I had no idea the word you were using.

13
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:55,310
Oh, it's so many pages.

14
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:00,341
Do I have to put my name in?

15
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:09,582
It's so many pages, bro.

16
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:15,934
All included in her communication.

17
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:27,096
Thank you.

18
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:50,214
Well, the sticky note brainstorming thing we did out in the friendship circle and then dividing up, I mean, that was all included, heard in communication.

19
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:55,690
And then rearranging the sticky notes and all that good stuff.

20
00:17:10,469 --> 00:17:21,323
for themselves but also for me and we hang them on the board and we revisit them regularly and it's a lot easier for me to say like you said this is how you wanted to

21
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:37,328
you're still talking about the interconnectedness between.

22
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,769
species here, right?

23
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:35,940
Yes, biodiversity is necessary.

24
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:26,362
And there's lots of places where we have people go out and we're paying to remove honeysuckle, or we are going out volunteering to remove honeysuckle, right?

25
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:33,650
With our IB science juniors, we are working together with IAMS.

26
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,833
And IAMS is focusing on bird scats.

27
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,636
Is it really worth the time to remove all these invasives?

28
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:40,778
Is it helping the birds?

29
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:41,679
Is it hurting the birds?

30
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:42,900
What kind of biodiversity

31
00:23:57,292 --> 00:23:58,528
They all die.

32
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:10,260
those to whatever standards you'd like if you want to use this exact same activity.

33
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,854
be like, all right, who knows what this word means?

34
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,337
Who knows what this word means, right?

35
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:40,060
Because that's the objective.

36
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,370
So then last year, with the mindset of Project Credible, I started to put a little bit more of this on the students.

37
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,760
So more of them dissecting the objective and them modeling what they think this is going to look like.

38
00:28:45,668 --> 00:28:45,787
Thank you.

39
00:30:00,982 --> 00:30:03,290
Now go ahead and go to the second part.

40
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,861
Join your shoulder partner or group mates and see if you came up with similar definitions.

41
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:08,547
So just talk about what you wrote down.

42
00:30:09,249 --> 00:30:12,038
If you knew one that they didn't, then go ahead and talk to them about that.

43
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:54,597
random, no plan pattern, systemic, no plan pattern.

44
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:33,527
right looking for the beginning letter

45
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:45,529
So go ahead and flip the paper, but try not to look at the adjoining page.

46
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:46,931
I know that's silly.

47
00:31:46,951 --> 00:31:51,296
So just try and flip it and look at this one right here, where it says third, fourth, fifth.

48
00:31:53,358 --> 00:31:54,680
Don't look at the adjoining page.

49
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,903
It's just there for the next step.

50
00:31:57,923 --> 00:32:00,166
So now third, fourth, fifth.

51
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:03,109
And once again, we're doing this with our students.

52
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:09,578
Yeah.

53
00:35:58,175 --> 00:36:01,550
to this exact same coordinate and look at this exact same spot.

54
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:07,054
They could assess the biodiversity year after year and compare that to other places, right?

55
00:36:29,174 --> 00:36:30,517
up a little bit at the moment.

56
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:48,178
So we're going to change it up just a little bit when we get outside, and we're actually going to decide what species we see the most of, and then we're going to classify those as A through B. So we all have like five species that are common, and then we're going to have

57
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:23,700
Once again, this is just stuff I show my students on Canvas.

58
00:37:51,946 --> 00:37:52,948
at your objective again.

59
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:57,539
So we are going to figure out, evaluate population abundance of non-modal species.

60
00:37:58,582 --> 00:38:00,326
What does that mean?

61
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:00,647
Non-movie.

62
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:02,411
We are going to estimate.

63
00:38:02,651 --> 00:38:03,273
Is it going to be perfect?

64
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:05,217
Heck no.

65
00:38:05,237 --> 00:38:08,244
We're going to do random, systematic, or transect.

66
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:09,347
What do y'all think if we're using hula hoop?

67
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,409
and see where it lands.

68
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,853
So when I first started doing this, it was in January.

69
00:38:27,993 --> 00:38:33,158
We were outside, and we were just assessing the biodiversity of what's in the grass, really.

70
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:44,649
And now we have a native garden, so we can use it a little bit more for that and stuff.

71
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:47,031
So yeah.

72
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,733
So you need your journal.

73
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:15,009
I think what we're going to do now is I left the hula hoops outside.

74
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:18,054
We're not using quadrants.

75
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:21,940
Grab a partner, grab a hula hoop, and I'll give you further instructions.

76
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,207
We're going to kind of go wear moth and batlets.

77
00:39:26,287 --> 00:39:28,530
And bear poop.

78
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,672
Close your eyes.
