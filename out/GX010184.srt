1
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,453
[SPEAKER_09] So Josh, is the goal to have a place-based curriculum ready for 2033?

2
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:48,843
[SPEAKER_09] That's our next adoption.

3
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:53,713
[SPEAKER_07] 2033, so it's eight years.

4
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:19,846
[SPEAKER_09] But in eight years, I think you could do a curriculum.

5
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,770
[SPEAKER_09] Like, I think it would be good to sell one to all of Tennessee.

6
00:01:23,432 --> 00:01:35,471
[SPEAKER_09] Well, and if you could integrate them with chemistry and biology, they're all going to be readopted in 2033.

7
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:41,301
[SPEAKER_09] And I think place-based education is good for the kids.

8
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:45,215
[SPEAKER_09] But we're going towards these storyline-based things.

9
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:52,423
[SPEAKER_09] The problems that we have is they don't have a lot of labs in them, the one that we purchased, which is making the kids actually get out and do less.

10
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,231
[SPEAKER_09] But they're doing less.

11
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,254
[SPEAKER_09] It's all paperwork.

12
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,297
[SPEAKER_09] And that's not good for kids.

13
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:36,903
[SPEAKER_09] I got it.

14
00:04:36,924 --> 00:04:38,536
[SPEAKER_09] I just had the wrong thing selected.

15
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:40,632
[SPEAKER_09] Like I know I knew how to do this.

16
00:06:13,762 --> 00:06:16,515
[SPEAKER_09] Okay.

17
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:17,437
[SPEAKER_09] collaboration in co-design?

18
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:30,233
[SPEAKER_12] Can you just swap them?

19
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:37,603
[SPEAKER_09] No, no, no, we're not staying in the friendship circle.

20
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,567
[SPEAKER_10] Yes.

21
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:43,911
[SPEAKER_09] Yeah, we're going into a river.

22
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:47,317
[SPEAKER_09] Which, but I mean.

23
00:07:47,357 --> 00:07:51,121
[SPEAKER_04] Leave the poncho behind and just commit to it.

24
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:53,704
[SPEAKER_04] And just go swimming.

25
00:07:55,607 --> 00:08:07,581
[SPEAKER_07] Multiple times this week I've gotten that little pew pew.

26
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,984
[SPEAKER_00] We're high enough in the mountains, we're not.

27
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:10,945
[SPEAKER_00] We're uphill.

28
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:06,852
[SPEAKER_09] So those lab safety things were driving me nuts.

29
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,416
[SPEAKER_09] The day I was doing it, it kept on click.

30
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:19,091
[SPEAKER_09] I'm like, I got to the point where I took a picture of the answer that I put and then pushed submit because I couldn't get one to stay.

31
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:25,341
[SPEAKER_09] And I submitted my answer and them telling me that it was the right answer because I could only get a 90 on that one.

32
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:26,663
[SPEAKER_09] I think it's like number three.

33
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:51,098
[SPEAKER_06] However many times you have to take it to get 100 but made me look like an idiot that I took it four times to try to get this 100 when I was getting it right every time.

34
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:39,141
[SPEAKER_12] I had them make the graph that the data table together and then I put it in

35
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:15,363
[SPEAKER_00] Okay, that's cool.

36
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:17,266
[SPEAKER_12] That's cool, art and data, okay, that's cool.

37
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:27,724
[SPEAKER_12] How many of you, I know some of you used it last year, how many of you used Code App at all with the students before?

38
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:30,629
[SPEAKER_12] This last year, Jen last year, cool.

39
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,035
[SPEAKER_12] Any other tools that you've used around,

40
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:50,421
[SPEAKER_06] Yeah, it's easy for them to get lost.

41
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:39,105
[SPEAKER_10] know what we get.

42
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:19,269
[SPEAKER_12] I'm super energetic.

43
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:12,889
[SPEAKER_09] Allison was asking about Excel, but kids don't have it.

44
00:14:12,909 --> 00:14:13,250
[SPEAKER_12] Right.

45
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,356
[SPEAKER_12] And very similar to Google Sheets.

46
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:17,897
[SPEAKER_12] Pretty much.

47
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,781
[SPEAKER_10] Google's getting there.

48
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,923
[SPEAKER_10] Google's trying to get there.

49
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,506
[SPEAKER_10] It's the shortcuts that's different, really.

50
00:14:24,526 --> 00:14:25,468
[SPEAKER_10] Shortcuts.

51
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:30,656
[SPEAKER_10] But you can input your own shortcuts into Google Sheets, though.

52
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:34,782
[SPEAKER_10] So it's pretty useful.

53
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:34,902
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

54
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:55,058
[SPEAKER_12] So how about this, if you wanna go.

55
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:35,288
[SPEAKER_09] It's all going in there all that just makes my soul happy

56
00:16:37,478 --> 00:16:38,199
[SPEAKER_09] I love that.

57
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:38,940
[SPEAKER_09] Right?

58
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,783
[SPEAKER_09] And then so they could all see it.

59
00:16:40,803 --> 00:16:46,752
[SPEAKER_09] Like, if your grade band was all studying, like, you want our butterflies, everybody goes out on this day.

60
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:49,476
[SPEAKER_09] That's crazy, Mom.

61
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:50,538
[SPEAKER_09] Yeah.

62
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:57,889
[SPEAKER_09] But if you had a curriculum that we all shared that Tennessee adopted that was play-spaced and data-driven.

63
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,075
[SPEAKER_09] They should be able to fit it in there if they wanted to.

64
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:02,796
[SPEAKER_09] Right?

65
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,599
[SPEAKER_09] Like, think about storylines.

66
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,282
[SPEAKER_09] Everybody's doing it.

67
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:12,462
[SPEAKER_09] We could make this more interactive.

68
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:14,624
[SPEAKER_06] And it doesn't matter if you're inner city.

69
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:19,910
[SPEAKER_09] You're representing the city demographic.

70
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:25,295
[SPEAKER_09] And you can, whatever bugs, you identify everything that you see that day at your school.

71
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,896
[SPEAKER_09] And so does every other school.

72
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:29,119
[SPEAKER_09] And then the next day, everybody goes back.

73
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:37,928
[SPEAKER_09] And you could see the difference between Farragut and West, or Farragut and Nashville,

74
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:52,062
[SPEAKER_09] He said that wasn't part of his plan.

75
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:53,666
[SPEAKER_09] Just giving resources.

76
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:58,617
[SPEAKER_03] Want to write a curriculum?

77
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:10,232
[SPEAKER_09] But a series of Tennessee wants to adopt something that a new teacher can just pick up.

78
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:16,280
[SPEAKER_03] Which is scripted and it's killing me.

79
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,141
[SPEAKER_09] Poor Allison.

80
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,704
[SPEAKER_09] She came to the opening training with me.

81
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,986
[SPEAKER_09] And she's like, doesn't that take all the art out of teaching?

82
00:18:22,046 --> 00:18:24,790
[SPEAKER_09] And I'm like, I feel so good.

83
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,156
[SPEAKER_10] I graduated from UT in December of 2022.

84
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:35,035
[SPEAKER_05] So I came in right whenever they were wrapping up the standards that we were on board.

85
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:38,087
[SPEAKER_10] And I was like, oh, so this is what it's like to be a teacher.

86
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,562
[SPEAKER_09] Well, I moved here two years ago.

87
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:43,863
[SPEAKER_09] They gave us pre-AP.

88
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,128
[SPEAKER_09] And so I was the first one to teach it.

89
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:49,591
[SPEAKER_09] I went through it all.

90
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:52,535
[SPEAKER_09] I added things in for the implementation, lined up all the notes.

91
00:18:52,995 --> 00:18:55,318
[SPEAKER_09] And then they go and change editions.

92
00:18:55,338 --> 00:18:56,920
[SPEAKER_09] And this one's so scripted.

93
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,545
[SPEAKER_09] And the stuff we learn here is so cool.

94
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:04,510
[SPEAKER_09] And to not be able to implement any of it hurts.

95
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,252
[SPEAKER_09] So I'm in mornings.

96
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:25,216
[SPEAKER_09] But I think this group could write a group.

97
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:30,002
[SPEAKER_09] And write one that went from middle school through high school.

98
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:35,007
[SPEAKER_09] So what you do builds on what we do.

99
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:42,103
[SPEAKER_09] Like they're doing all this research.

100
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:44,206
[SPEAKER_09] I feel like it should go into curriculum planning.

101
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:03,008
[SPEAKER_09] And I agree that it should just be lessons to implement that all go together.

102
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:09,516
[SPEAKER_09] I mean, I like the idea of a phenomenon that leads all the instruction and the kids finding out things and problem-based learning.

103
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:16,773
[SPEAKER_09] to like the science of the moment, like what the kids asked.

104
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:20,477
[SPEAKER_09] Like there's no leeway in what we've got right now.

105
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,347
[SPEAKER_09] And I swear if they'd chosen to stickleback fish, like my kids would want to like jump off the bridge.

106
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:32,512
[SPEAKER_01] Because six weeks talking about a stickleback fish, we can't leave.

107
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:40,262
[SPEAKER_10] I have like 15 lessons worth, and there's sometimes more than one day for each lesson about bath bombs.

108
00:20:44,866 --> 00:21:02,993
[SPEAKER_09] Getting them through the full period.

109
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,799
[SPEAKER_10] there goes a little too much into it.

110
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,029
[SPEAKER_10] A lot of these kids already know what an atom is, or they know what molecules are.

111
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:31,140
[SPEAKER_10] Whenever we're talking about platforms, we have to sit there and not say the word atom or molecule.

112
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:57,972
[SPEAKER_09] It's word we earn.

113
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,801
[SPEAKER_00] Kitem.

114
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:19,316
[SPEAKER_10] Kitem has organized all of our content into one platform, but it's all of the sci-ed stuff, like storylines and everything.

115
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:27,788
[SPEAKER_10] But they've just organized it into Kitem, and we're supposed to be getting these workbooks for them to work out of.

116
00:22:27,808 --> 00:22:32,515
[SPEAKER_03] And I...

117
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:41,340
[SPEAKER_10] that they were going to be giving us them.

118
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:51,130
[SPEAKER_10] My thing is I would like to see it now and they haven't given us a copy of what the students will look like.

119
00:22:52,191 --> 00:22:58,978
[SPEAKER_10] All I have is two teachers editions for the first unit and the second unit.

120
00:22:58,998 --> 00:23:03,042
[SPEAKER_10] They haven't given us anything else.

121
00:23:13,417 --> 00:23:15,563
[SPEAKER_01] think it's just

122
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:52,186
[SPEAKER_10] They really enjoy seventh grade science.

123
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:55,270
[SPEAKER_10] That's where you see a lot of their growth.

124
00:25:01,822 --> 00:25:11,798
[SPEAKER_10] Wednesday the other two science teachers from my grade at my school are meeting

125
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:27,432
[SPEAKER_08] He's the one that keeps sneaking in little projects.

126
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,553
[SPEAKER_08] I'm like, stop it, man.

127
00:26:28,593 --> 00:26:30,315
[SPEAKER_08] He's just a little scattered, I think.

128
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:31,096
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah.

129
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,119
[SPEAKER_04] He's got a seven-year-old kid.

130
00:26:34,681 --> 00:26:35,302
[SPEAKER_08] I mean, I get it.

131
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:36,463
[SPEAKER_08] I met him during.

132
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:38,106
[SPEAKER_08] I was still like, seriously?

133
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:38,466
[SPEAKER_08] Come on.

134
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:41,170
[SPEAKER_08] Just open them all up at the beginning of the semester.

135
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,816
[SPEAKER_08] And the other teacher I have, I opened them all up, but she has a really strict policy.

136
00:26:46,016 --> 00:26:46,737
[SPEAKER_08] You can turn it.

137
00:26:52,167 --> 00:27:00,884
[SPEAKER_08] Do them all ahead of time, just don't submit them.

138
00:27:01,465 --> 00:27:09,822
[SPEAKER_09] You would also probably enjoy their fishy climate training.

139
00:28:51,271 --> 00:29:08,233
[SPEAKER_09] Drag it over to Nick's new because it's gigantic and I don't

140
00:29:30,758 --> 00:29:36,079
[SPEAKER_09] He's just gonna accumulate stuff.

141
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,452
[SPEAKER_05] So yeah, take the time, drag everything you don't use.

142
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:33,568
[SPEAKER_02] I don't really have an idea who this is, but what I love, and I say this to my staff, is the norms are great, and almost everybody can come up with a good set of norms.

143
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:44,400
[SPEAKER_02] The living within those norms is tricky, because oftentimes, and one of our usual norms is, take ownership over the impacts that you have.

144
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:49,626
[SPEAKER_02] And usually everyone's like, of course I do that, but you don't always know the impacts that you have.

145
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:56,970
[SPEAKER_02] And sometimes you can hurt somebody's feelings, never know that you did, because you certainly didn't intend to.

146
00:31:57,511 --> 00:32:02,218
[SPEAKER_02] But something you said or a way that you said it caught somebody wrong.

147
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,044
[SPEAKER_02] And in those moments, you'd never know.

148
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:12,113
[SPEAKER_02] Like the person would be hurt, the person who did it would never know, and we'd all go on, and the system remains the same.

149
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:18,583
[SPEAKER_02] But in our situation, and what I like about our staff and what I like about this group already is,

150
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:30,968
[SPEAKER_02] sharing that sense that I got my feelings stepped on, or this happened and I just wanted to bring it up.

151
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:32,270
[SPEAKER_02] So it came to me.

152
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:36,357
[SPEAKER_02] And so I just want us to know, this stuff is happening.

153
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:39,182
[SPEAKER_02] And we don't mean it, and we don't intend it, typically.

154
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:41,466
[SPEAKER_02] So.

155
00:32:53,545 --> 00:33:05,091
[SPEAKER_02] Really focus on how we respond to things how we talk about things language that we use and

156
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,189
[SPEAKER_02] Don't sit there.

157
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:16,011
[SPEAKER_02] Don't suffer.

158
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:21,204
[SPEAKER_02] Don't think, oh, it's just because of this or that, or they didn't mean it, so I'm just not going to say anything.

159
00:33:21,244 --> 00:33:22,787
[SPEAKER_02] If you had that moment, just say it.

160
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:26,296
[SPEAKER_02] I mean, this is probably the most friendly group of people you're going to work with.

161
00:33:26,476 --> 00:33:29,002
[SPEAKER_02] I mean, these are people that really want to do the best by everybody.

162
00:33:29,784 --> 00:33:30,546
[SPEAKER_02] So this is how we learn.

163
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,310
[SPEAKER_02] And this is what happens in classrooms.

164
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:49,578
[SPEAKER_02] We're going to be working together all afternoon, all evening, tomorrow, and then hopefully later on after we leave here.

165
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:52,304
[SPEAKER_02] And I want everybody to feel good about ourselves.

166
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:55,211
[SPEAKER_02] This is not like, this is not John's calling somebody else.

167
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:59,682
[SPEAKER_02] He's just recognizing that somewhere along the line, we didn't quite live up to our boundaries.

168
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:15,447
[SPEAKER_02] But maybe, I mean, we may spend a little more time even in the next couple of days just unpacking, like what does this look like?

169
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,110
[SPEAKER_02] What does this look like when it doesn't happen?

170
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,775
[SPEAKER_02] Have you ever had it happen that you got something hurt and the person didn't know?

171
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:23,717
[SPEAKER_02] They didn't know?

172
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:26,983
[SPEAKER_02] Were you able to bring it up?

173
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:29,266
[SPEAKER_02] Was there enough safety there to bring something?

174
00:34:29,286 --> 00:34:30,568
[SPEAKER_02] Like that's tricky.

175
00:34:30,588 --> 00:34:33,972
[SPEAKER_02] I'm just glad to know that this is that kind of place.

176
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:35,935
[SPEAKER_02] So these are sitting over there.

177
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,617
[SPEAKER_02] We wrote them down.

178
00:35:11,887 --> 00:35:35,346
[SPEAKER_02] What time do you think that will end up being?

179
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,515
[SPEAKER_02] We'll take another look at the weather then.
