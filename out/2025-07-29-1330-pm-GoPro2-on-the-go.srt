1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,462
Okay.

2
00:00:01,482 --> 00:00:03,103
It wasn't on.

3
00:00:03,124 --> 00:00:03,904
Mine did the same thing.

4
00:00:03,985 --> 00:00:04,665
It wasn't on.

5
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:06,608
Mine did the same thing.

6
00:00:06,668 --> 00:00:07,789
So what is yours doing?

7
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,812
Because his might not have as much battery.

8
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:12,475
No, his was on.

9
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,416
The screen will go out.

10
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:17,961
Welcome back y'all to this other side of the valley.

11
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:22,747
The West Farm Trail yesterday we had the chance to explore towards the cemetery.

12
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:26,832
We're going to end at the cemetery today, but we'll do a little loop on our hike.

13
00:00:27,588 --> 00:00:49,843
and during our little hike we are going to have the chance to put on our learner hat one more time and practice a strategy and activity that we love here that also we've heard from a lot of educators is really applicable across grade levels and content areas and we've heard lots of creative ways that this is being used.

14
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,988
It's an activity called beach to teach to

15
00:00:53,407 --> 00:01:08,706
And this morning I was really thinking about Eat, Shoe, Teach, Shoe when John read the quote at breakfast by Rachel Carson where she talks about how knowing is not half as important as loving.

16
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:18,418
And Eat, Shoe, Teach, Shoe gives us the space to really love and connect with this place or the place where you find yourself in.

17
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:23,890
and it gives you that chance to connect and maybe in a little bit new or different way.

18
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:34,768
Yesterday we connected with salamanders and salamanders are so cute and they have the littlest, tidiest toes and sometimes little black toe paths and like it's like love at first sight with a salamander.

19
00:01:34,788 --> 00:01:44,524
But when you're in the woods or you're in your neighborhood or you're in a park we might not connect with everything as quickly or as deeply as the face or the toes of a salamander.

20
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:55,717
but East Shoe Teeshoe gives us a lens to start to think about that connection, to see our place in maybe a little bit different way.

21
00:01:55,737 --> 00:02:03,031
And oftentimes when we are doing science, we think about the so what.

22
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:07,660
We're just a welcome home committee, that's why.

23
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:20,837
She says she's a retired teacher.

24
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:36,837
I don't think when I during the time I was here.

25
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,400
How's the pension?

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,028
3rd, 4th, 7th.

27
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:45,175
All of the above.

28
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:47,360
Mostly science.

29
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:50,246
Science, STEM.

30
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:56,580
There is no pension.

31
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:16,435
More teachers!

32
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:21,724
Yes.

33
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:32,680
So oftentimes this week we are really focused on data collection, thinking about this probabilistic thinking and revising our thinking, collecting more data, adding to the story.

34
00:03:33,321 --> 00:03:38,368
And oftentimes we wait till the end of that process to think about the so what behind it.

35
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:40,812
So what, why are we even studying this?

36
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:50,766
But making these connections helps us put that so what at the beginning to help frame and connect us to the work throughout the process instead of just at the end.

37
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:54,073
So here's how each two teach to is going to work.

38
00:03:54,534 --> 00:04:01,045
In just a minute we will all together as a group hike up to that junction where yesterday we veered off to the right up to the cemetery.

39
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:11,202
The whole group is going to stay put at that spot and I as a lonesome hiker is going to head up the trail for a little bit.

40
00:04:11,182 --> 00:04:14,387
And as I am hiking, I'm going to be looking for something cool.

41
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:22,658
It could be a species, it could be a medicinal plant, it could be connecting with the sounds around us, it could be artistic.

42
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,427
Something that stands out to me in the trail in that space.

43
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:39,282
And after about two-ish minutes, Grayson is going to send the first two people up the trail.

44
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:44,712
And those first partners, their job is to hike until you find me.

45
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:56,309
When you find me, I am going to teach you about whatever thing I stopped to look at or connect with, and then that becomes your station.

46
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:05,944
So then you and your partners stay put there, and you will then teach the subsequent partners whatever that thing was as they come through.

47
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:17,467
You are all teachers, so whatever I teach you is one way to say it, but you might have a way to add to it, to give it a little flair, add a little creativity.

48
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,701
So the way that you deliver and share that thing is up to you and your partner.

49
00:05:24,487 --> 00:05:50,005
after did you want to say okay no i'm modeling the sleeves okay so after about two more minutes Grayson will send the next pair that pair will hike up the trail until they find the first pair they will stop at that first pair and learn whatever the fact is from that pair that first pair will stay put the second pair keeps hiking until they find it

50
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,419
And then I will teach them something at that spot.

51
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,963
That will become their station.

52
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,185
They make it their own.

53
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,427
Think about how they want to share it.

54
00:05:58,788 --> 00:05:59,529
They stay put.

55
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:00,310
I keep hiking.

56
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:03,455
Two minutes later, Grayson sends the third pair.

57
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,740
That third pair stops at the first pair and learns.

58
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,044
Stops at the second pair and learns.

59
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:10,787
Keeps hiking until they find me.

60
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,649
I will teach them something.

61
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,075
This might be a really bad game of telephone.

62
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:16,195
Yeah.

63
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:22,367
So we are all unzipped along the trail.

64
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:24,491
Grayson is going to be last.

65
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:30,704
So once everybody has their station, she will come to you and you can teach her your thing.

66
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:35,854
When you see Grayson, you know that John is done.

67
00:06:36,239 --> 00:07:03,715
after you teach and then she's going to kind of stay put and you will make your way for the stations ahead of you you are then the participant she will then come to the next station they will teach her that they will keep walking the next they will keep walking until we all zip back up into one group at the end where another junction What questions do we have about each student?

68
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,327
If it doesn't make sense, yeah, that's fine.

69
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:10,810
It'll be very clear what you need to do one step at a time.

70
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,812
It feels like a gallery wall.

71
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,234
Similar to a gallery wall?

72
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:16,837
Yep.

73
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:17,098
All right.

74
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:22,644
So as I said in my instructions, and as the name implies, you do need a partner for this activity.

75
00:07:22,664 --> 00:07:26,509
So if you'll take a moment, find one other person to work with.

76
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,812
And if we are odd, we are all odds.

77
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:33,938
But if we are unodd, then we could have a one group.

78
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,459
So give your partner a high five when you've got them.

79
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:46,847
That was awkward.

80
00:07:47,452 --> 00:07:54,041
Everybody is partnered?

81
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:54,983
It was his camera.

82
00:07:55,203 --> 00:08:01,472
All right, I'm going to start making my way very soon.

83
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:07,781
Yeah, you're blending.

84
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,223
Everybody's blending in with their shirts.

85
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:26,132
It's me!

86
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:36,355
Are we starting up there?

87
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:43,547
They're all going at the same time.

88
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:50,458
If we shared this with our school group, then we got it all wrong.

89
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:58,030
It's like as we went along, the person at the station would tell us that all of the people knew the next one.

90
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:01,976
Then we'd pick that person and they'd tell us about it.

91
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,540
And we like walked in the last circle.

92
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:22,883
I'm happy right now.

93
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:37,163
Without the sleeves.

94
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:43,472
I decided to layer this so I can wear the shirt.

95
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:46,997
Now I've got a dress under it and I don't know how long that'll last.

96
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:49,450
Sure might come off.

97
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,973
Sure might come off.

98
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:56,798
Have you seen Mr. Moss?

99
00:09:57,979 --> 00:10:04,246
It's got a very dramatic... It's like it needs the shape.

100
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,088
Sporophytes or something.

101
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,589
Oh wow!

102
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:13,295
It's so... Yeah, it looks unusual.

103
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:15,938
It looks like it's just lifting.

104
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:24,816
Well, it's, yeah, I mean, it's a little bit of, see, yeah, a little bit of foliage growing out of it.

105
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:35,730
I mean, these little structures are not lifted so much as eroded.

106
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:42,579
You know, the little stone kind of protected that as the rain maybe was hitting it.

107
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,144
And here, I mean, probably this moss is keeping it from

108
00:10:46,630 --> 00:11:03,887
We should do okay Grayson you have you got something they're gonna do here We're just waiting.

109
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:14,958
I don't think anybody should I think everybody should try to find a caterpillar.

110
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:15,118
I

111
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:35,976
All right, first buddy pair may launch.

112
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:54,623
all right trio all right for those of us who are waiting um bonus points for the first person to find a caterpillar there's also a lot of poison ivy around us so caterpillar hunt with care

113
00:11:54,603 --> 00:12:01,390
No, I don't know what it's like.

114
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,433
You get tokens, I'm in.

115
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:14,644
Grace behaviorist, all the way.

116
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:18,427
I didn't know that.

117
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,049
I'm hoping I will have behaviorist.

118
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,752
No, I don't think so.

119
00:12:22,772 --> 00:12:23,833
No, I don't think so.

120
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:32,203
Oh, I'm so sorry.

121
00:12:32,453 --> 00:12:57,752
I got hired to do it because I had worked in school gardens and they were like so when have you

122
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,353
When have you been in the classroom before?

123
00:13:01,473 --> 00:13:06,639
And I was like, oh, you know, just like, I didn't even grow up in a public school.

124
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:08,280
Like our hall pass is real.

125
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,624
I didn't have much leeway to do.

126
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:22,335
I just turn on the back shirts and sit and wait for 25 minutes.

127
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:24,617
That was something.

128
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:39,518
This job is always a little bit different.

129
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:56,424
Let me take a picture.

130
00:13:56,605 --> 00:14:05,356
Did you see this one?

131
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:06,838
See this one over here?

132
00:14:09,518 --> 00:14:11,262
This one on the other side of that log.

133
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:27,561
Should get the shelf mushrooms.

134
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:29,987
Yeah, I feel like those are common though.

135
00:14:30,027 --> 00:14:30,488
Yeah.

136
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:32,771
More common than that for sure.

137
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:37,978
What about the little bitty ones there?

138
00:14:37,998 --> 00:14:39,800
Yeah, there's like those and then those.

139
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,303
It looks like those is what those turn into.

140
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:43,485
I don't see these.

141
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:44,126
So one's a bitty?

142
00:14:44,706 --> 00:14:47,190
Yeah, I think those are little and those are bigger.

143
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,992
That starts looking like this.

144
00:14:50,187 --> 00:15:07,740
Yeah, I don't know but those don't have see those almost start as like regular mushroom heads Whereas that one doesn't seem like the start of the head You know See

145
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,085
Oh, my gosh.

146
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:14,088
I'm almost buzzing in here.

147
00:15:14,108 --> 00:15:14,428
Mm-hmm.

148
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:34,993
All right, guys, group, onwards.

149
00:15:35,013 --> 00:15:35,213
All right.

150
00:15:48,153 --> 00:16:09,576
All right, got it.

151
00:16:09,596 --> 00:16:09,976
I kind of remember.

152
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:10,737
No, I remember when I was in college.

153
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:11,398
I spent my classes all the time.

154
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:11,999
I didn't even have some hair.

155
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:12,439
I'm just an educator.

156
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:13,300
It's like, oh, I'm so glad I've seen that.

157
00:16:19,642 --> 00:16:36,942
Yeah.

158
00:16:42,338 --> 00:17:07,620
Thank you.

159
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:29,777
And then giving them

160
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:49,210
because they're not learning nearly as much socially as they please have to do.

161
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:52,615
And really, yeah, it's still, I mean, it's been long.

162
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,857
Right, I think it just popped out.

163
00:17:54,877 --> 00:17:55,198
I'm done.

164
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,860
We came back off that road.

165
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,443
We went out and just came pulling off railroad tracks.

166
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:19,542
Really easy.

167
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:36,899
And there's a part in the book where he talks about like, um, it's become really socially acceptable if you're done talking to somebody you just gave your phone to and that's when he signals you and he doesn't want to talk to them anymore.

168
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:45,327
And I feel like the Gen Z stare is a version of that where it's like, my son does it all the time, he's 14, and I'm talking to him and he's just looking at me and I'm like, you need to say like, okay, or I hear you, or can you clarify, like, where can I be?

169
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:49,732
But he'll just get up and walk away.

170
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:50,372
Following me.

171
00:18:51,794 --> 00:18:52,495
It's following me.

172
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,697
It sure is.

173
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,624
Oh my gosh.

174
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:08,952
How am I going to get ahold of my child?

175
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:10,510
They're not supposed to be on it anyway.

176
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,652
They're not supposed to be on it.

177
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:15,975
We're moving to the yonder couches this year.

178
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:16,915
We have phone jails.

179
00:19:17,536 --> 00:19:18,937
We have really good principals also.

180
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:23,341
There's not a principal in our building that you could call and be like, this kid's mom keeps calling him.

181
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,804
And they wouldn't come in and be like, phone jail.

182
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,207
They have a box and it's got a padlock.

183
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:31,608
Get in phone jail.

184
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,849
Your mom can come get it later.

185
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:38,854
If my mom texted me in school, it would have said, I hope you get detention finished.

186
00:19:39,357 --> 00:19:45,514
It better be an emergency.

187
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,662
Oh, hey, I'm picking you up later.

188
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:49,304
I love you.

189
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,811
Like you don't need to check right now.

190
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:54,598
It's the, and then it ties into just the anxiety around it.

191
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,318
But it's like, there's a notification, I saw this, I gotta check it.

192
00:19:57,378 --> 00:19:57,999
I need to check it.

193
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,041
I need to look at it.

194
00:19:59,101 --> 00:20:00,343
I need to do this.

195
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:01,224
I need to do this.

196
00:20:01,385 --> 00:20:08,837
It's so wild being here where I don't get most of the, like, culture of TikTok and stuff.

197
00:20:08,897 --> 00:20:13,384
And at my house, I have no internet.

198
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:14,967
That'd probably be good.

199
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:20,281
having one of the cameras towards the end and Vincent's already gone so you'll have one towards the middle.

200
00:20:20,983 --> 00:20:22,848
Was it intentional to have it upside down?

201
00:20:22,868 --> 00:20:24,432
That's what he said.

202
00:20:24,472 --> 00:20:28,382
He said otherwise it kind of starts to fall over.

203
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:35,811
So hopefully when it goes to play the video there's the rotate button.

204
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,373
It's going to be all kinds of awkward.

205
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:43,802
He was looking at it last night.

206
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,367
Hey Josh, what's up?

207
00:20:47,948 --> 00:20:52,294
Kim here, coming to you from the trail.

208
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,473
Reporting from Project Credible.

209
00:20:56,356 --> 00:21:04,450
Science teachers want to know, what do you think of pineapple on pizza?

210
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:10,100
I will eat one piece of it, but other than that, no.

211
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,846
I'm a vegetable on pizza person, not a fruit on pizza person.

212
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:14,407
Okay, okay.

213
00:21:14,627 --> 00:21:14,908
All right.

214
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,113
Hoping for a different perspective here.

215
00:21:19,747 --> 00:21:22,761
I'm all about charcuterie boards, so bring it on.

216
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:23,645
Yeah, bring it on?

217
00:21:23,665 --> 00:21:26,498
Yeah, bring it on.

218
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,250
So, the question is, what do you at home think?

219
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:31,433
Pineapple on pizza.

220
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:32,554
Like and subscribe.

221
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:34,657
Right.

222
00:21:34,677 --> 00:21:37,600
Just tap that subscribe button right down there, y'all.

223
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,923
Tap a little like, you know, if you like what you see.

224
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:45,090
Or if you don't like what you see.

225
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,734
If you want to see more data science education, like and subscribe, yo.

226
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:51,137
Yo.

227
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:52,620
Hey bro, we want to see you.

228
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:57,710
We do need a teacher channel.

229
00:21:58,171 --> 00:21:59,373
Legit.

230
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:11,978
Today in the life.

231
00:22:13,122 --> 00:22:14,645
Do you need to go to the bathroom?

232
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,168
And you're like, no, I said skivity.

233
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:19,936
I said, skid marks in your pants?

234
00:22:19,956 --> 00:22:23,163
I'm like, no, you don't go to the bathroom and take care of that.

235
00:22:23,183 --> 00:22:25,868
And nobody, they stopped with that in my class.

236
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,873
It took about three or four people to do that.

237
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:33,865
And I was like, oh, that's embarrassing for you.

238
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:39,793
I told you, you out weird.

239
00:22:40,514 --> 00:22:41,795
You gotta be the alpha weird.

240
00:22:41,995 --> 00:22:43,517
You gotta be the alpha weird.

241
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:52,088
And I feel like there's such value for them seeing an adult be goofy and embarrassing and like, yep, listen, the world kept turning.

242
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:59,238
Someday you'll accidentally embarrass yourself and yeah, things won't just stop.

243
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:03,463
Oh, when they're sagging, when they're sagging, you tell them all, unless you're a man pant.

244
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:08,457
I've never heard that.

245
00:23:08,898 --> 00:23:14,790
If I stay at my home, whatever I want to, those are hand pants.

246
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,818
I used to frequently, if the boys are wrestling, it's just like, can we just stop touching each other?

247
00:23:18,858 --> 00:23:23,848
Any goat works, boys, boys, boys, girls, boys, boys, girls.

248
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,584
I'll tell them to go in the hall.

249
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:28,567
I'm like, go touch yourselves in the hall, please.

250
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:30,209
So we have it on camera.

251
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:39,441
I used to, I used to, I would get up and be like, I don't mean to alarm you, but your butt has ticked off your pants.

252
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:42,325
And they're running off.

253
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:45,209
And it's, they're so confused, they're like, ooh!

254
00:23:45,229 --> 00:23:46,511
All right, next.

255
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:47,132
Joey?

256
00:23:48,113 --> 00:23:49,455
Okay.

257
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:50,556
Is that a nest?

258
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:52,819
Oh, it sure looks like one.

259
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:53,380
My eyes are to see them.

260
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,789
I can't quite tell the definition that it looks like.

261
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:02,919
It looks like, yeah, a stick bundle rather than, um, like a burl or something.

262
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:03,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

263
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:03,840
That's what I was thinking.

264
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,002
Okay, I'm going to travel now.

265
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:08,928
You, yeah, brought the wrong person to tell you who might live in a nest like that.

266
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,110
Blair.

267
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:11,632
Um.

268
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,037
Oh, yeah.

269
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:15,598
Okay, great.

270
00:24:15,618 --> 00:24:17,722
I'm glad that you were able to follow me.

271
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:19,865
My eyes are not what they used to be.

272
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:22,489
It looks more leafy than sticky.

273
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:23,812
Is it?

274
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:27,557
From this angle but the sun's coming in so bright.

275
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:29,820
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:36,009
From here it looks more leafy than sticky.

277
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:41,297
I get called on to explain burrows in trees pretty, pretty often.

278
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:41,757
Cool.

279
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,343
And I've found that I tell kids oh it's like you know it's like a tree wart.

280
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:51,852
You know it's like a benign tree tumor and it's just got curly grain in there but it's

281
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,166
like the DNA went wonky and told it to grow a bubble.

282
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:56,588
Yeah.

283
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:58,271
Can that be insect-induced too?

284
00:24:58,992 --> 00:25:05,063
Certainly the galls can, but like the really big burrows in the trees tend to be solid rather than hollow.

285
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:05,243
Okay.

286
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:10,112
And the burrows are tree tissue, like cancerous tissue, right?

287
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:14,700
Essentially, in the sense that it's uncontrolled growth.

288
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,512
I had no idea what the difference was.

289
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,096
Warts don't have to be viral, but sometimes they are.

290
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:24,420
They are still benign overgrowth is what warts are.

291
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:31,787
I think I was using those interchangeably, not thinking about the reason for the distinction.

292
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:32,608
The root of the cause.

293
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:35,471
Yeah.

294
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:40,436
And sometimes a burl can result from damage to the tree and foreign DNA getting in.

295
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,338
That kind of tricks it into overgrowth.

296
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:44,080
Because I was thinking a lot of it was like

297
00:25:44,448 --> 00:26:08,683
scar mm-hmm it can start out as a scar okay all right y'all can head on all right oh those are cute see I would have stopped here and not even made it 30 seconds those are really pretty

298
00:26:10,199 --> 00:26:30,111
Like a cypress Like a brown cypress or a brown cedar?

299
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:34,198
Maybe You do have that flat scaly texture

300
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:57,882
I guess it would be cypress because they are flat.

301
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:04,270
These are, these, no, these are the, are these the, yeah, it's the one with two.

302
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,092
Do you remember the

303
00:27:07,422 --> 00:27:08,123
Not persimmon.

304
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:14,229
I swear it starts with a P though.

305
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:14,890
But you can't eat them.

306
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:16,352
It's got two eyeballs.

307
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,156
Oh, you see that?

308
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:23,019
I don't remember what they're called.

309
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,361
I learned it.

310
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:26,843
I learned it a year ago.

311
00:27:26,923 --> 00:27:27,944
Yeah, it's a distinctive feature.

312
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:28,665
It means it's edible.

313
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:32,269
Just with this particular plant, not when like general.

314
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:35,472
But I don't think I have service to do anything with it.

315
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,276
Well, I can take the picture then go back and lens it later.

316
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:40,499
I can't remember what it's called.

317
00:27:42,302 --> 00:27:43,563
But yeah, it is something edible.

318
00:27:44,344 --> 00:27:56,259
So the two means you... Yeah, just hold on to it though because I want to double check because if I don't... I'm pretty sure... Hold on.

319
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,441
You see the two eyeballs?

320
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,224
The lens is there.

321
00:28:00,585 --> 00:28:00,925
Right there.

322
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,248
I was holding it to the screen.

323
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,436
See, that supposedly means it's edible.

324
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,280
Alicia's going to try it.

325
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,144
Look, I have two berries.

326
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:21,827
It's just Grayson.

327
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:23,477
Okay, guys.

328
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,599
You already were looking at some stuff over there.

329
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,120
Yep.

330
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,141
That's the same stuff.

331
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:27,782
Same stuff.

332
00:28:27,882 --> 00:28:28,603
Oh, perfect.

333
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:29,965
So everyone has an example of it.

334
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:31,507
Anything unique about it?

335
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:32,228
You can eat it.

336
00:28:32,428 --> 00:28:32,588
Yes.

337
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:33,249
You can eat it.

338
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,331
Do you already know?

339
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:36,333
Do you know about it?

340
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,174
Yep.

341
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:37,655
You can eat it.

342
00:28:37,995 --> 00:28:38,236
Okay.

343
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,177
No, no, no.

344
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:40,619
Not that one.

345
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,861
How many seeds are you finding inside?

346
00:28:42,902 --> 00:28:43,803
You just ate two, right?

347
00:28:44,524 --> 00:28:45,225
How many seeds you got?

348
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:46,346
I don't know.

349
00:28:46,366 --> 00:28:47,347
I think I chewed them up.

350
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:48,048
Okay.

351
00:28:48,108 --> 00:28:51,072
You can kind of squeeze it if you want and you can kind of feel it pop.

352
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:54,018
But was there anything you noticed at the top?

353
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:54,478
Two eyeballs.

354
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:55,339
Two?

355
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:55,880
Okay.

356
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,041
So it's a berry.

357
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,747
What normally are in berries or on the sides of it?

358
00:29:03,068 --> 00:29:03,288
Seeds.

359
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:03,709
Seeds?

360
00:29:03,729 --> 00:29:03,829
Okay.

361
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:04,970
And so there is two holes.

362
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:07,373
So how many seeds do we presume is inside?

363
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:07,874
Two.

364
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:08,374
Two?

365
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:09,215
Two or four.

366
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:10,297
Yeah.

367
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:13,220
So obviously this is the reproductive part.

368
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:16,244
What makes you think about like how it was made?

369
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:19,928
How many individuals were involved for the flowering part?

370
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,961
it has to be sexual reproduction to have a seed and a fruit.

371
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:31,332
And each of those, like you squished it, but there was those two little holes on there, right?

372
00:29:31,652 --> 00:29:34,136
So you've got the two little holes, you've got the two little seeds.

373
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,222
What did those holes hold before?

374
00:29:38,684 --> 00:29:39,706
Like before the fruit formed?

375
00:29:39,726 --> 00:29:40,027
Flowers.

376
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:40,908
Yeah, the flowers.

377
00:29:40,928 --> 00:29:43,433
So two flowers, right?

378
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:44,835
So and it

379
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:46,298
OK, she's right there.

380
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:46,979
I think we'll be OK.

381
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,342
But so there's two flowers that was made.

382
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:55,267
And then we mentioned the leaves and I think we covered everything.

383
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:56,828
So do you guys want to know the name yet?

384
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:57,949
Yep.

385
00:29:57,969 --> 00:29:58,730
Partridge berry.

386
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,571
There it is.

387
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:07,639
It started with a P. It did start with a P. And then, yeah, so the ground cover, see how all the leaves are just twos and twos and twos and then two flowers, two seeds.

388
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:08,740
This one has four seeds.

389
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,581
Oh, sometimes fours.

390
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:10,842
Yeah.

391
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:11,002
Yeah.

392
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:11,903
If it's an even number.

393
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:12,203
Yeah.

394
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,865
You could have doubles.

395
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:14,265
Yep.

396
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:15,764
I got twins.

397
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,907
Okay guys, thank you so much.

398
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:21,572
Thank you.

399
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,976
It doesn't taste like much, but you can eat it.

400
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:26,039
There's more.

401
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:33,249
See, this is where I messed up with my students.

402
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:38,076
Once we got to there, the last one, when they told their story, we all missed one.

403
00:30:39,153 --> 00:31:06,337
Yeah, so by the end, the whole class met up at the end.

404
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:06,958
Where did you take your shoes?

405
00:31:06,978 --> 00:31:07,378
This on your campus?

406
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:07,499
Here?

407
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,439
No, this is a trip to chain off with the kids.

408
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:09,160
Yeah, we bring a group every year.

409
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:23,509
Um, we do a little bit of co-teaching.

410
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:26,554
Touch it.

411
00:31:27,234 --> 00:31:27,615
Touch it.

412
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:29,157
Thou shalt not pass.

413
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,138
But you can touch it.

414
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:32,662
We are, it is indeed a sensory station.

415
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,304
Touch my knees.

416
00:31:34,324 --> 00:31:34,645
Touch it.

417
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:35,666
Touch it.

418
00:31:35,746 --> 00:31:36,127
All of you.

419
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:37,909
You must participate.

420
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,231
You must touch and believe.

421
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,296
Tell me about your sensory leaf experience.

422
00:31:44,698 --> 00:31:45,359
That's very big.

423
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,401
And soft.

424
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:48,184
Underneath.

425
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:55,556
The top is more of a silky smooth, the bottom is more of a... Furry-ish?

426
00:31:56,297 --> 00:31:57,639
It's got texture.

427
00:31:57,879 --> 00:32:02,687
I don't know if I'd call it fuzzy or furry like a lamb's ear, but it's got texture.
