1
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:02,637
[SPEAKER_05] Parking tag?

2
00:00:02,657 --> 00:00:03,559
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

3
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:06,084
[SPEAKER_05] They probably won't tell me in the next half an hour.

4
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:10,734
[SPEAKER_02] No, we have like academic tags we can get to from two month staff.

5
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,217
[SPEAKER_05] Well, they gave me a parking tag.

6
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:13,720
[SPEAKER_05] I just haven't run it down.

7
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:14,462
[SPEAKER_05] No, I don't think so.

8
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:19,342
[SPEAKER_02] Hi.

9
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:20,503
[SPEAKER_02] What is your name?

10
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:21,404
[SPEAKER_02] I'm Tanya.

11
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:21,965
[SPEAKER_02] Hi.

12
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:23,346
[SPEAKER_02] Oh, welcome.

13
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,269
[SPEAKER_02] You know each other from Megabytes?

14
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,669
[SPEAKER_02] Yes.

15
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,371
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, good to have you here.

16
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,133
[SPEAKER_03] A different project.

17
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:32,377
[SPEAKER_03] We'll talk a little bit about why we're here.

18
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:36,902
[SPEAKER_03] Sorry to talk later, but thank you all for being here.

19
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:37,082
[SPEAKER_02] Hi.

20
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,083
[SPEAKER_02] Is it gone?

21
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:38,524
[SPEAKER_02] All good.

22
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:44,150
[SPEAKER_02] Hey, did you hear, by chance, two days ago they reported two cases of lacrosse in Knox County?

23
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:44,871
[SPEAKER_02] No.

24
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,094
[SPEAKER_02] No, that was on the news.

25
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:50,219
[SPEAKER_02] We'll talk later.

26
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:57,056
[SPEAKER_02] But yeah, it's like it wasn't there at all during our project and they just announced it on the radio.

27
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,244
[SPEAKER_02] I was actually going to email her.

28
00:01:03,228 --> 00:01:08,957
[SPEAKER_03] Hi, my name is Amanda and I'm very happy to be here with you today.

29
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:11,761
[SPEAKER_03] I'm going to go through some logistical stuff that I have to say.

30
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,044
[SPEAKER_03] Thank you for being here today.

31
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:20,474
[SPEAKER_03] I'm going to be facilitating this focus group and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts before we jump into the full experience of Tremont.

32
00:01:21,095 --> 00:01:27,565
[SPEAKER_03] Today's conversation is a part of our research on how educators engage with data, place-based learning, and probabilistic thinking.

33
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:43,171
[SPEAKER_03] Since some of you are returning from year one and others are just joining, we want to take some time to understand where everyone is starting from, what prior experiences you've had, how you currently approach data or place-based practices, and what drew you to this PD in the first place.

34
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:52,827
[SPEAKER_03] This is a chance to hear your stories, your questions, and what you're hoping to get out of the experience, and your insight will help us shape the program and better understand how to support teachers across different backgrounds.

35
00:01:53,465 --> 00:01:57,869
[SPEAKER_03] So this session is being recorded so we can go back and accurately capture what was shared.

36
00:01:58,209 --> 00:01:59,510
[SPEAKER_03] It's only for research purposes.

37
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:04,935
[SPEAKER_03] Everything you say will be kept confidential, and we will remove names or identify details during analysis and reporting.

38
00:02:05,395 --> 00:02:06,696
[SPEAKER_03] It's a voluntary conversation.

39
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:14,103
[SPEAKER_03] You're welcome to skip any question or topic that doesn't feel relevant or that you'd rather not talk about, and you can leave the group at any time, no questions asked.

40
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:22,830
[SPEAKER_03] To get us started, if you can just go around and share your name, your role, whether this is your first year with Project Credible or if you're returning,

41
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:24,364
[SPEAKER_03] and your school.

42
00:02:24,984 --> 00:02:26,146
[SPEAKER_03] We can start there.

43
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:26,867
[SPEAKER_02] I'm Tanya.

44
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,191
[SPEAKER_02] This is my first year in this program.

45
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:37,781
[SPEAKER_02] I was interested because I've worked with Josh before on a frog ectotherm project.

46
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:43,289
[SPEAKER_02] And I've worked with UT before with what he was talking about the megabytes is a mosquito study.

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,812
[SPEAKER_02] So I just like the collaborative work.

48
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:47,194
[SPEAKER_02] So ectotherm ER?

49
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:48,335
[SPEAKER_02] Was that last?

50
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:48,696
[SPEAKER_05] Yes.

51
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,779
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah, I did that last summer.

52
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,581
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I did it summer before last.

53
00:02:53,371 --> 00:03:03,928
[SPEAKER_00] I'm Justin this is my first year and I got emailed by another Knox County teacher out of the blue and thought that sounds kind of cool.

54
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:20,374
[SPEAKER_00] Teaching is my third or fourth career depending on how you count it and so I worked in zoos and aquariums before this and so getting people interested in anything related to animals and conservation is something that I want to look into and work with.

55
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:21,958
[SPEAKER_04] I'm Lisa Jacobs.

56
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,862
[SPEAKER_04] I teach biology and anatomy at Hardin Valley.

57
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:47,593
[SPEAKER_04] It's my first year with this project and I heard about it from Ann who works with Tremont and I've been really interested in finding more local sources of data, things to kind of tie my kids into local things that they care more about within my biology classes.

58
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:50,057
[SPEAKER_01] I'm Allison Sieber.

59
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:52,400
[SPEAKER_01] I'm a student intern with Michelle Hughes.

60
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,182
[SPEAKER_01] She'll be my mentor at Farragut High School.

61
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,004
[SPEAKER_01] It'll be for ninth grade biology.

62
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:59,648
[SPEAKER_01] I'm currently at UTK for grad school and science education.

63
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:04,594
[SPEAKER_01] I just got back for conservation work with jaguars and black bears.

64
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:09,339
[SPEAKER_01] So she thought I would definitely enjoy this, especially being out in the Smokies.

65
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:16,466
[SPEAKER_01] And I really just want to see how wildlife and conservation work in the Smokies can tie into teaching education.

66
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:20,067
[SPEAKER_05] I'm Michelle Platt and I work at Farragut High School.

67
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:23,255
[SPEAKER_05] I'm a ninth grade biology teacher and it's my second year with Tremont.

68
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:29,449
[SPEAKER_05] I started the same as Lisa to try to integrate more place-based learning into my biology classes.

69
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:32,155
[SPEAKER_05] I think it makes the students more interested.

70
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:34,641
[SPEAKER_05] The closer you can keep it to home.

71
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,951
[SPEAKER_03] Can we go around?

72
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,332
[SPEAKER_03] How long have you taught?

73
00:04:37,492 --> 00:04:39,093
[SPEAKER_03] And you told us your school.

74
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:40,214
[SPEAKER_03] So how long did you teach?

75
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:42,937
[SPEAKER_05] Well, I've taught a lot of things.

76
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:43,838
[SPEAKER_05] My husband was military.

77
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,380
[SPEAKER_05] I've had my teaching degree for 13 years.

78
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:47,641
[SPEAKER_05] OK.

79
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:53,587
[SPEAKER_05] I taught second, then third, then fifth, then eighth, and now I'm on my third year of ninth grade biology.

80
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:54,808
[SPEAKER_03] Nice.

81
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,010
[SPEAKER_03] And you said that you're a student intern?

82
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:57,730
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah.

83
00:04:59,072 --> 00:04:59,212
[SPEAKER_04] OK.

84
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:05,117
[SPEAKER_04] I started teaching about 28 years ago, but this is my 15th year that I'm starting.

85
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,833
[SPEAKER_04] teaching.

86
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:07,854
[SPEAKER_04] And what school are you at?

87
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,435
[SPEAKER_04] Hardin Valley.

88
00:05:09,997 --> 00:05:18,325
[SPEAKER_00] I'm at Halls and this is my fourth full year, fifth year teaching biology, chemistry, and AP biology.

89
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:22,930
[SPEAKER_02] I've been teaching since 2003.

90
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:34,682
[SPEAKER_02] At Bearden I teach wildlife conservation, AP environmental, CP environmental, and AP research.

91
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:40,389
[SPEAKER_02] And like you, I was a zookeeper and it was zookeeping that got me into education.

92
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,410
[SPEAKER_02] I was like the only keeper that liked doing the talks with people.

93
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,643
[SPEAKER_03] Well, I mean, there's a lot of varied experience here, for sure.

94
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:57,953
[SPEAKER_03] And I'll tell you, like, I've been a teacher for a long time, and now I want to be a zookeeper, so maybe I can... It's a pay cut.

95
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:00,637
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I was just getting ready to say... I got into teaching for the money.

96
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:01,959
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, seriously.

97
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,321
[SPEAKER_02] It's not a joke.

98
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:05,204
[SPEAKER_02] Seriously, it's not a joke at all.

99
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:11,414
[SPEAKER_03] No, I've looked into it, like, because I grew up on a farm and had some experience with that, and I was like, oh.

100
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:14,258
[SPEAKER_03] Well, you get to, like, be around animals all day.

101
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:16,802
[SPEAKER_03] I started in research, so this is my cut.

102
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:27,022
[SPEAKER_03] So our first question is, before joining Project Credible, what experiences have you had with place-based education or teaching with community resources?

103
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,450
[SPEAKER_05] Why don't we start over there, because mine is mostly Project Credible.

104
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:35,394
[SPEAKER_05] And you talked a little bit about Megabytes.

105
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:41,423
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, just through UT really is how I've heard about all the collaborative opportunities.

106
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:46,350
[SPEAKER_02] The Megabytes was a mosquito research, and our students

107
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:52,274
[SPEAKER_02] Um, literally set up mosquito traps to collect the eggs.

108
00:06:53,476 --> 00:07:01,126
[SPEAKER_02] So anyway, most of my, with the community has been through UT, um, and then the frogs, the ectotherm ER.

109
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:07,013
[SPEAKER_05] Um, so it sounds like you jump on all the opportunities we have here as well.

110
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:11,379
[SPEAKER_02] And that's where, to me, I'm fortunate with the wildlife class.

111
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,861
[SPEAKER_02] I don't have a state test.

112
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,421
[SPEAKER_02] I taught biology for 15 years.

113
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:18,024
[SPEAKER_02] I'm so glad I'm over that.

114
00:07:18,124 --> 00:07:20,227
[SPEAKER_02] I mean, it's just the whole state testing thing.

115
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:25,092
[SPEAKER_02] So I have the time to be able to do that where a lot of classes don't.

116
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:31,860
[SPEAKER_02] And so, like she had said, I just like being able to connect my kids to things that are local.

117
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:36,446
[SPEAKER_02] I bring students up here every year to Tremont for a weekend trip.

118
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:38,528
[SPEAKER_02] And I don't know.

119
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:39,946
[SPEAKER_02] Just Tremont's amazing.

120
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:44,294
[SPEAKER_02] So anything that involves Tremont along with a collaboration with UT, I'm all in.

121
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:49,544
[SPEAKER_05] I don't know if they let schools borrow things, but we were all in on the ectotherm ER.

122
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,289
[SPEAKER_05] Our curriculum's changing, but we bought a bunch of eye buttons.

123
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:53,651
[SPEAKER_05] Okay.

124
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:57,879
[SPEAKER_05] If you ever need to borrow them, I don't know if they let them let us swap out.

125
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:58,580
[SPEAKER_02] I know Bartlett.

126
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:00,043
[SPEAKER_02] He was at Bearden for

127
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:17,408
[SPEAKER_00] over a decade i'm sure bartlett would allow it yeah as long as they came back they're expensive of course so who else what else kind of community um i i'm fairly new to teaching like i said this is my my fourth full year um i this will be my

128
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:23,917
[SPEAKER_00] third year teaching AP Biology and so I'm trying to incorporate more hands-on experiences with that.

129
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:32,208
[SPEAKER_00] We go to a local beaver pond out there on Norris Freeway right there next to the Walmart and we do a stream survey but it's like a one-day thing.

130
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:44,627
[SPEAKER_00] I'm trying to work up to getting more students so that I can maybe do something like coming out here or when I was in high school I went to the, it's now called the Chesapeake Bay Field Station down in Wallops Island, Virginia.

131
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:51,598
[SPEAKER_00] and did like a weekend of field ecology and intertidal zones and that's kind of why I ended up working in aquariums for 15 years.

132
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:58,689
[SPEAKER_00] And so doing that stuff and getting into that and trying to incorporate more of that into my teaching.

133
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,096
[SPEAKER_05] You should look for Fishy Climate next spring with Dr. Zingley.

134
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:04,879
[SPEAKER_05] You'd like that one too.

135
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:07,763
[SPEAKER_05] It's about stream surveys and such.

136
00:09:08,198 --> 00:09:33,092
[SPEAKER_04] We have started bringing a few classes up here up to the Smokies for their like we do salamanders and lichen counts for like an afternoon and we've done a lesson with the Chesapeake Bay which is not local but it's the kids really enjoy it even though it's not here having that place to kind of be like oh

137
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,965
[SPEAKER_04] something attached to that data that we've done that has gone really well.

138
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:42,597
[SPEAKER_04] So I'd love to see something even closer that they can identify with.

139
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:43,740
[SPEAKER_04] Awesome.

140
00:09:44,800 --> 00:10:05,403
[SPEAKER_01] So I obviously have not taught anybody or anything like that but I think for my own education what I would try to do is I knew my interests were in like wildlife and biology so I took classes at Scholl's Marine Laboratory and it's where undergrads or anybody who's wanting to take a college level course is able to access the first marine lab in the U.S.

141
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:08,547
[SPEAKER_01] and it's off the coast of Maine at Appledore Island

142
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:14,825
[SPEAKER_01] And it's just like nestled with a bunch of islands, but you're at a field station and really focused on conservation.

143
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:24,019
[SPEAKER_01] And it like tries to have a lot of diverse professors from different institutions that do like their own research, or maybe they're just not even professing anymore.

144
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,567
[SPEAKER_01] And they're like actually out in the field working and they'll come and teach classes for about two weeks.

145
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:32,773
[SPEAKER_01] So I was able to take like field animal behavior and shark biology and conservation.

146
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:33,915
[SPEAKER_01] So it's really cool.

147
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,057
[SPEAKER_01] I got to meet like.

148
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,986
[SPEAKER_01] Two of the most renowned like shark biologists are doing stress physiology on the blood work of sharks.

149
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,029
[SPEAKER_01] We didn't get any sharks.

150
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:49,299
[SPEAKER_01] So that was a bummer, but it's like, they like try to like broadcast it for like a wide range of students.

151
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,361
[SPEAKER_01] And it was very interesting.

152
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:54,507
[SPEAKER_01] I got to meet a lot of students from Cornell university and university in New Hampshire.

153
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,088
Cool.

154
00:10:56,249 --> 00:11:02,883
[SPEAKER_05] I am in my second year of Tremont, and as I've said, I've acquired a lot of different classes.

155
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:12,925
[SPEAKER_05] I've gone to Fishy Climate with Dr. Zingley, and then I did the Ectotherm ER through UT, as well as Tremont last year.

156
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:21,818
[SPEAKER_05] I feel like a lot of us are interested in place-based learning and bringing the kids to conservation because of experiences we've had.

157
00:11:22,178 --> 00:11:35,035
[SPEAKER_05] Like I can remember in elementary school going to a nature's classroom and we spent a week there and there's a lot, I'm from New England, so we did a lot of sea-based stuff as well that was all place-based.

158
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:37,137
[SPEAKER_05] And I think maybe those things just stuck with me.

159
00:11:37,618 --> 00:11:40,161
[SPEAKER_05] And so if you teach kids

160
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:47,670
[SPEAKER_05] early on about where they live, it stays with them, whether they realize it or not.

161
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,431
[SPEAKER_03] It's very connected.

162
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,413
[SPEAKER_05] You're saying it makes you connect relevant.

163
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:53,036
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah, it's very relevant.

164
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:53,156
[SPEAKER_03] Cool.

165
00:11:53,176 --> 00:11:58,482
[SPEAKER_03] Again, a lot of varied experiences with like play space, lots of different critters and watersheds.

166
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:04,409
[SPEAKER_03] Now let's do a little switch over to data and data literacy and working with data.

167
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,355
[SPEAKER_03] So how have you approached data literacy or working with data in your classroom so far?

168
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:26,609
[SPEAKER_02] me personally, I, unfortunately, time wise, I tend to get a data set that's already made, like one I find online, like, more study and range of tolerance.

169
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,274
[SPEAKER_02] There are these really cool data sets about two different fish.

170
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:36,181
[SPEAKER_02] And, you know, this fish can survive at low temperatures, this fish survives at high temperatures.

171
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,163
[SPEAKER_02] And so the data sets already there.

172
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:39,645
[SPEAKER_02] And

173
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:59,780
[SPEAKER_02] allowing the students to be able to interpret data, try to figure out from the data table what's happening, and then I use Google Sheets to have them input the data and then highlight it and turn that into a graph.

174
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,865
[SPEAKER_02] And so they can visualize the data

175
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:05,646
[SPEAKER_02] but they're not coming up with it.

176
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,392
[SPEAKER_02] I haven't found, other than the wildlife class,

177
00:13:12,295 --> 00:13:19,887
[SPEAKER_02] With other classes, I feel like I don't have the time to actually do the experiment to collect the data than to analyze the data.

178
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,151
[SPEAKER_02] I just it's too time restrictive.

179
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:37,054
[SPEAKER_02] But having good data sets that might already be out there from the Smokies and just bringing that in and then being able to look and analyze, you know, what's happening to our population.

180
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:38,741
[SPEAKER_02] of salamanders.

181
00:13:38,881 --> 00:13:42,251
[SPEAKER_02] Is the fungus that's affecting frogs affecting salamanders?

182
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:52,039
[SPEAKER_02] And having data that's already there for them to analyze would be very helpful to me, but that's how I tend to use it.

183
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:58,811
[SPEAKER_00] There's been a switch recently in Knox County towards storylines.

184
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:02,415
[SPEAKER_00] In fact, we're going all storylines with the new biology curriculum.

185
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:10,545
[SPEAKER_00] And a lot of those include controlled lab situations where they generate data and they have to graph the data.

186
00:14:11,566 --> 00:14:16,132
[SPEAKER_00] And so there's some of that with biology, particularly the honors classes that I teach.

187
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:18,495
[SPEAKER_00] It's a little more limited with the CP classes.

188
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,418
[SPEAKER_00] But with AP biology, it's a lot of

189
00:14:22,225 --> 00:14:26,590
[SPEAKER_00] 25% of the time is supposed to be lab time, 25% of the class, rather.

190
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:45,673
[SPEAKER_00] And so between osmosis and all of the data that we need to generate and chi-squared and all of these things, standard deviation, all of these labs that we do working toward understanding those numbers, they generate their data, they analyze their data, they graph their data, and working on that is primarily where we use it.

191
00:14:46,474 --> 00:14:50,359
[SPEAKER_00] But like I tell the kids in my biology class, so much of the state test is

192
00:14:50,693 --> 00:14:53,655
[SPEAKER_00] reading and understanding what they give you.

193
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,489
[SPEAKER_00] You don't have to memorize

194
00:14:55,975 --> 00:15:02,104
[SPEAKER_00] science facts, you have to be able to read a graph or read a paragraph and pull out the pertinent data.

195
00:15:02,645 --> 00:15:05,989
[SPEAKER_00] And so it's not just true for the state test, it's true for the ACT.

196
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,414
[SPEAKER_00] If you take the science portion, it's all reading and comprehension and graph.

197
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:16,364
[SPEAKER_00] And so being able to use that is an important tool that I like to try and press on them.

198
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:24,075
[SPEAKER_00] And so, especially with the storylines, they've been getting more and more graph reading and literacy and understanding and interpreting these graphs.

199
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:32,778
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I would, I mean that's just a great compilation of all the things that I feel like is going on in my room.

200
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:42,503
[SPEAKER_04] Having that data because we don't, there's just not time to be able to collect all the data and have a robust sort of data set so.

201
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:54,539
[SPEAKER_04] Definitely what attracted us to the Chesapeake Bay story was the data that they had that was just, there it is, we can look at it, we can graph it, we can try to make sense of it.

202
00:15:54,619 --> 00:16:05,153
[SPEAKER_04] So again, going back to that idea of looking at what you have and being able to make sense of it and pull meaning out of it has definitely been our focus.

203
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:09,439
[SPEAKER_01] So for me, once again, was not a teacher.

204
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:11,562
[SPEAKER_01] However, I think

205
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:18,817
[SPEAKER_01] From what I recall in high school, I had no exposure to anything really with data, doing graphs or anything like that.

206
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:28,031
[SPEAKER_01] It was just like definition based the entire time and then just regurgitating the information out on the test and then like expecting good results that way.

207
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:33,860
[SPEAKER_01] So I safe to say, I don't recall anything from biology and undergrad or not undergrad and high school.

208
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,925
[SPEAKER_01] And then I got exposure in college.

209
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,236
[SPEAKER_01] became, in my opinion, data-like literate.

210
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:52,790
[SPEAKER_01] I could read it, I could pull information from the paragraph, understand models, and then I got better at it actually this summer, because I worked in an actual carnivore lab and doing all the data stuff, and I got exposure to Excel.

211
00:16:54,752 --> 00:17:00,118
[SPEAKER_01] Knowing how formulas work and like that, but unfortunately in high school, no exposure really whatsoever.

212
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:03,402
[SPEAKER_01] And that was eight years ago, I think.

213
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:11,105
[SPEAKER_05] I definitely agree with the time crunch, but I disagree with just using crunched data sets.

214
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:17,656
[SPEAKER_05] I think part of the kids taking ownership is getting some of that data itself.

215
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:24,327
[SPEAKER_05] Though when they get their own data, the big problem is them learning how to use whatever

216
00:17:25,673 --> 00:17:33,541
[SPEAKER_05] data analytic you're using, whether it be data classroom or Google Sheets, getting the kids to learn how to function in that.

217
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:42,289
[SPEAKER_05] But I think when it's their own data, they have more buy-in, and I like to try to get them doing as much of it themselves.

218
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:55,242
[SPEAKER_05] We do have a lot of data that we are already given, and we do canned graphs and interpreting graphs, but I like to make sure that I build in labs where they're collecting their own data.

219
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:59,597
[SPEAKER_03] Well, and the next question, we've kind of covered this at the beginning.

220
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:07,208
[SPEAKER_03] Is there anything that you all want to add about why you decided to participate in Project Credible and what you're hoping to gain?

221
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,873
[SPEAKER_03] So we talked a little bit when you introduced yourself about like why you're here.

222
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:16,521
[SPEAKER_03] Is there anything else you want to add to that about why you chose this and what you hope to get out of it?

223
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:37,686
[SPEAKER_00] I'd like to get a field experience that I can bring my AP bio students for and like figure out like maybe maybe I can find something around here that we can like work on because as it is I take them for like a three-hour trip to a beaver pond which is you know pretty nice but there's a lot more we could do.

224
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:40,870
[SPEAKER_03] You're in the right place for that.

225
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:47,858
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah I would like to know too if there like with the exotherm ER that we did

226
00:18:48,800 --> 00:19:00,134
[SPEAKER_02] knowing, like being, I guess being given a project where we could make those frogs, take the temperatures, collect that data, like having something- Contribute to something bigger.

227
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:01,015
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah.

228
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:17,454
[SPEAKER_02] And plus that gave, instead of having to spend the time to go out and find all the research, if there's something that could say, hey, we need help with this and help me focus to help my students and say, this is what we need help with.

229
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:18,756
[SPEAKER_02] Here's what you could do.

230
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:24,438
[SPEAKER_05] And they really liked that that was connected to a larger problem that they were actually contributing to that data.

231
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,520
[SPEAKER_05] They like to contribute.

232
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,265
[SPEAKER_05] They like to feel like what they're doing is meaningful.

233
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,529
[SPEAKER_03] Like citizen science projects.

234
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,872
[SPEAKER_05] Yes, exactly.

235
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:32,853
[SPEAKER_05] Exactly.

236
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:34,897
[SPEAKER_03] Well, again, right place.

237
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,622
[SPEAKER_03] We're in the best place for that, right?

238
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:43,020
[SPEAKER_03] The last thing I have is a statement on whether you agree or disagree and how you feel about it.

239
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:51,933
[SPEAKER_03] Some people might say that things like place-based learning and data science are nice extras in the science class, but that learning science is really about understanding universal concepts.

240
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,255
[SPEAKER_03] How do you feel about that statement?

241
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:56,640
[SPEAKER_04] I don't think it's extra.

242
00:19:56,861 --> 00:20:02,209
[SPEAKER_04] I think it's part of the universal concepts of science is that idea of

243
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:09,912
[SPEAKER_04] What are I mean, none of that other stuff would be there if we weren't collecting any data and working with that data and taking meaning from that data.

244
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:11,817
[SPEAKER_05] Science isn't isolated.

245
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,922
[SPEAKER_05] You need to make connections.

246
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,853
[SPEAKER_05] Science is all about connecting with the natural world and understanding it better.

247
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:19,557
[SPEAKER_05] I don't think you can separate the two.

248
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:31,429
[SPEAKER_01] I know for me when we would learn things that were like more personal to our area, it like made me feel more connected with the, not just the community, but also like science.

249
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:34,253
[SPEAKER_01] And for me, I was more engaged with my learning.

250
00:20:34,513 --> 00:20:36,236
[SPEAKER_01] So like give us something about the Smokies.

251
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:38,680
[SPEAKER_01] I was like, Oh, that's like, I live right there.

252
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,884
[SPEAKER_01] Like I just now recently learned about the synchronous fireflies.

253
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,186
[SPEAKER_01] I had no clue.

254
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:44,048
[SPEAKER_01] And I'm like, that's cool.

255
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,450
[SPEAKER_01] That's like on my doorstep.

256
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,371
[SPEAKER_01] So.

257
00:20:46,351 --> 00:20:54,722
[SPEAKER_01] like play space learning is something I never really got too much and I think it would be very interesting to learn on how to like do an education matter behind it.

258
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,007
[SPEAKER_03] Okay.

259
00:20:59,027 --> 00:20:59,888
[SPEAKER_03] Well, thank you.

260
00:21:00,089 --> 00:21:01,631
[SPEAKER_03] Is there anything else we want to add?

261
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:03,032
[SPEAKER_03] That's all I've got for today.

262
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:06,417
[SPEAKER_03] Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

263
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:11,403
[SPEAKER_03] The recording and transcript will be kept on the university's Google Drive and will be password protected.

264
00:21:11,463 --> 00:21:15,328
[SPEAKER_03] If you have any questions, just feel free to contact me or Dr. Rosenberg.

265
00:21:16,355 --> 00:21:18,197
[SPEAKER_03] Thank you Commander Josh.
