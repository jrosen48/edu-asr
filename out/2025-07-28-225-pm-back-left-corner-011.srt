1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:21,082
[SPEAKER_04] We have a CS class at the middle school and that's what our kids are required to use.

2
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:24,267
[SPEAKER_01] It's like

3
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:25,531
[SPEAKER_01] It could be cute.

4
00:00:25,912 --> 00:00:27,536
[SPEAKER_01] It's like a little game.

5
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:40,011
[SPEAKER_01] It's like you gotta get the little guy to lay the egg.

6
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,537
[SPEAKER_01] I'd give you observations last year, do the team rubric observations.

7
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:47,904
[SPEAKER_01] And one of the classes I had to observe was our computer science teacher.

8
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:53,273
[SPEAKER_01] And I would go in with the rubric and be like... And he's not allowed to make any of his own lessons, right?

9
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:57,820
[SPEAKER_01] They just have him go on Kira, and the kids log on to Kira, and that's the whole class.

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,466
[SPEAKER_01] It's like they log in to Kira, and they do the Kira lessons.

11
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,311
[SPEAKER_01] And I'd be like, yeah, they are...

12
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,336
[SPEAKER_01] This is gamified learning.

13
00:01:06,557 --> 00:01:08,321
[SPEAKER_01] That is a check on the room.

14
00:01:08,862 --> 00:01:09,865
[SPEAKER_01] That's a five in my book.

15
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:14,376
[SPEAKER_01] That's a five in my book, so I really admire any way you do that.

16
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:15,398
[SPEAKER_01] I should be doing that.

17
00:01:15,547 --> 00:01:18,350
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I totally bounced from that.

18
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,234
[SPEAKER_04] I was telling her, I bounced from that to code.org, make code.

19
00:01:22,314 --> 00:01:23,595
[SPEAKER_01] Make code.

20
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,617
[SPEAKER_01] Have you used Tinkercad at all?

21
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:26,678
[SPEAKER_04] Yes, we use Tinkercad.

22
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:34,306
[SPEAKER_04] When the 3D players were up and running, we really used it for the 6th graders, but they used Tinkercad just to design stuff.

23
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:36,829
[SPEAKER_04] And I said, next year, the 7th, you'll get to use it.

24
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,330
[SPEAKER_04] And they're like, yay.

25
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:39,271
[SPEAKER_04] And I'm like, great.

26
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:41,594
[SPEAKER_04] One less thing to deal with using Tinkercad.

27
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:42,735
[SPEAKER_01] I think they used code.org.

28
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,925
[SPEAKER_01] The kids don't like it.

29
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:49,049
[SPEAKER_01] I already know they hate it.

30
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,071
[SPEAKER_01] They hate it.

31
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:53,897
[SPEAKER_04] And I also take my kids out to the garden too sometimes.

32
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:56,682
[SPEAKER_04] Take us over to the garden and kill time.

33
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:00,488
[SPEAKER_01] There was a really neat...

34
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:04,732
[SPEAKER_01] It was with someone who works at UT.

35
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:13,161
[SPEAKER_01] They did a cohort of how to use computer science in other subjects besides just computer science.

36
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:19,947
[SPEAKER_01] We used MakeCode and used the little hummingbird kits.

37
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,509
[SPEAKER_01] Have you heard of these?

38
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,555
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, so it's like a little circuit guy and

39
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:39,663
[SPEAKER_01] And so it's like a little circuit and it's called a hummingbird.

40
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:47,822
[SPEAKER_01] It connects to MakeCode and you can program it on the MakeCode website.

41
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:52,667
[SPEAKER_01] And then you plug it in, like plug the hummingbird into the Chromebook.

42
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:56,912
[SPEAKER_01] And it talks, the Chromebook talks to the hummingbird.

43
00:02:56,932 --> 00:02:59,895
[SPEAKER_01] And it can do a lot of different things.

44
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,799
[SPEAKER_01] So like, the hummingbird has like an 8-bit LED.

45
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,983
[SPEAKER_01] It's like just 8 little LED lights, right?

46
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:14,350
[SPEAKER_01] And you can code it to make a message and flash a sign or like a happy face.

47
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:18,953
[SPEAKER_01] or you can connect a motor to it and it'll do different things.

48
00:03:20,175 --> 00:03:32,411
[SPEAKER_01] And that was, my kids really enjoyed doing that because it was like, it's very different from Kira, whereas Kira is like, you need to get the duck to the egg.

49
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:38,700
[SPEAKER_01] Whereas with MakeCode, I could be like, you can do literally anything.

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:59,203
[SPEAKER_01] at all with this website and they enjoyed that a lot because they had the foundation of computer science that someone had already taught them, not me because it didn't go with my standards that good, but like when we did our biomes unit and so we made a soil humidity

51
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:00,105
[SPEAKER_01] Tester.

52
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:08,081
[SPEAKER_01] And all it is is like if there's water present in the circuit then it closes the circuit and then the light turns on.

53
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:14,053
[SPEAKER_01] And if there's no water in the soil then the light won't turn on because it doesn't close the circuit.

54
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,618
[SPEAKER_01] And we did that and it was like

55
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,161
[SPEAKER_01] Computer science, but it was also science.

56
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:20,324
[SPEAKER_01] It was like a bios lesson.

57
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:34,907
[SPEAKER_01] Um, and it was it was a water sensor So I would look into that and we got a grant and I have a class that Like 25, you know, I have 16 maybe 12.

58
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,353
[SPEAKER_01] So they would share like once a while

59
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:56,983
[SPEAKER_02] don't know.

60
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:19,562
[SPEAKER_01] It looks like this It's literally just a little circuit and it's really ugly but it's I always tell them like that's what the inside Yeah, so that's a hummingbird

61
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:41,280
[SPEAKER_01] and it works with the the make code website and what's that other device there's something else that you can use that i'm going to plug up to the computer and you can code it that we had i cannot think of the name of it we had a few devices so this is what our moisture thingy looked like and it's literally just like we're trying to see the little lights

62
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,126
[SPEAKER_01] And you would set it to be like, if there's water, then there's a happy face.

63
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:45,767
[SPEAKER_01] Like, that's the code.

64
00:05:45,787 --> 00:05:46,629
[SPEAKER_01] It's really simple.

65
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,956
[SPEAKER_01] Then you put the little guys in the plant, and if there's water, then the happy face comes up.

66
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:55,082
[SPEAKER_01] If there's no water, then there's no happy face.

67
00:05:55,102 --> 00:06:00,351
[SPEAKER_04] See, we don't have a microwave, but I see what you're saying, because they make those things, they make code.

68
00:06:00,491 --> 00:06:02,234
[SPEAKER_04] But we did have, we had spheros.

69
00:06:02,374 --> 00:06:04,197
[SPEAKER_01] Oh, yeah, yeah, spheros.

70
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,182
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, we had those, so Spheroes are great.

71
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:09,090
[SPEAKER_04] So sixth grade would be those for computer science sometimes.

72
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:16,390
[SPEAKER_04] And if you use the coding activity, you can use your phones or the computers, whatever you want to have access to.

73
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,481
[SPEAKER_04] And they will code the Spheroes into different actions.

74
00:06:20,461 --> 00:06:39,432
[SPEAKER_01] with different lessons

75
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:56,172
[SPEAKER_01] Of like things you can do if you did have the micro bit and then also projects that you can do on just the make And in the lessons of materials that are needed as fun as Kira

76
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:02,936
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, so my best friend quit teaching this year, which I'm really sad about.

77
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:07,524
[SPEAKER_01] She works in HR now and takes the same amount of money and gets to work from her house, so good for her.

78
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,251
[SPEAKER_01] But she was the computer science teacher at our school.

79
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:17,383
[SPEAKER_01] And so I would always go into her room and be like, hey, this is so much more fun than what I'm doing.

80
00:07:17,363 --> 00:07:23,072
[SPEAKER_01] So it's funny to hear you guys saying that you made it because I'm like, it sounds so fun.

81
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:26,998
[SPEAKER_01] Just the way it lends itself to freak out.

82
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,410
[SPEAKER_01] Like it's more project based and it's less like, I feel like our creation is really steered towards.

83
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:40,478
[SPEAKER_01] We're going to take a test in the fall, we're going to take a test in the spring, and then we're going to take another test in the spring.

84
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:47,127
[SPEAKER_01] And like that's kind of what I have to structure my whole year around is like, did you practice the test every day?

85
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:53,175
[SPEAKER_01] Like what are you doing to practice for the test instead of like, did you think today?

86
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,358
[SPEAKER_04] Are you talking about computer science?

87
00:07:55,378 --> 00:07:57,161
[SPEAKER_01] No, I teach sixth grade science.

88
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:57,782
[SPEAKER_01] Science.

89
00:07:57,802 --> 00:07:59,604
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, science, science, science.

90
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:00,966
[SPEAKER_01] Does it have to be outside?

91
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,851
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I don't want to fool with science.

92
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:06,755
[SPEAKER_01] I'd rather it be computer science.

93
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:08,998
[SPEAKER_04] Well, computer science is not that hard.

94
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:12,203
[SPEAKER_04] It's just that what they give us to use is terrible.

95
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:12,403
[SPEAKER_03] Oh, yeah.

96
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:13,725
[SPEAKER_03] No, it's not enough at all.

97
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:14,927
[SPEAKER_04] It's terrible.

98
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:17,030
[SPEAKER_04] Honestly, I bounce around.

99
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,074
[SPEAKER_04] I mean, we could do that with some plans.

100
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:27,242
[SPEAKER_04] I have drones, so I pour STEM into computer science classes.

101
00:08:27,782 --> 00:08:29,584
[SPEAKER_02] What do they know about STEM?

102
00:08:29,705 --> 00:08:32,027
[SPEAKER_01] Have you done anything with them?

103
00:08:32,227 --> 00:08:35,371
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, they need to be able to.

104
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:43,880
[SPEAKER_04] No, but the previous teacher did, and since my class, but I've received the classroom since I was so many years old.

105
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,703
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, oh that's right, that's right.

106
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:48,998
[SPEAKER_04] I'm kind of glad I switched it in.

107
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:58,391
[SPEAKER_04] I love technology and have a degree in computer engineering, digital media, and all that, and social work, and got a master's in education in UT Tech.

108
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,653
[SPEAKER_04] Anyway, that's all, whole story.

109
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:03,418
[SPEAKER_04] But, um, so I liked it.

110
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:07,564
[SPEAKER_04] I liked, especially it just happened so suddenly, and a previous teacher left a mess.

111
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:09,687
[SPEAKER_04] So I took a whole school year.

112
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:14,876
[SPEAKER_04] And then once that fence was cleaned up, they said, oh, we're going to find her.

113
00:09:14,896 --> 00:09:16,839
[SPEAKER_01] I'm just going to start running around.

114
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:17,681
[SPEAKER_01] No, no, no.

115
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:17,861
[SPEAKER_01] It's OK.

116
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:18,422
[SPEAKER_01] Yes, they came.

117
00:09:18,502 --> 00:09:20,906
[SPEAKER_04] I would need to sort of hold up on my phone.

118
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:23,631
[SPEAKER_04] I told her, but they came one day in September, so I'm coming around.

119
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,314
[SPEAKER_01] Probably in the middle of your lesson, too.

120
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:25,915
[SPEAKER_01] Oh, yeah.

121
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:26,055
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

122
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:30,440
[SPEAKER_04] And then we had cleared the room out so kids and stuff started to get stolen.

123
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:38,309
[SPEAKER_01] And then they kind of finished it by a few months ago.

124
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,492
[SPEAKER_04] Some of the studios still was not done.

125
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:48,200
[SPEAKER_04] I emailed my principal about my TVs they took down and told us it's actually smashed but they restored another teacher.

126
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,005
[SPEAKER_04] One fell into it and then another one started beating the mess out of it.

127
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,827
[SPEAKER_04] They said it was broken, I might as well destroy it.

128
00:09:54,807 --> 00:10:03,336
[SPEAKER_04] So yeah, I really don't know if my room was even done really for real for right now.

129
00:10:03,816 --> 00:10:05,358
[SPEAKER_04] So I can't even tell you.

130
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:11,224
[SPEAKER_04] But anyway, TV production kids love that.

131
00:10:11,304 --> 00:10:14,568
[SPEAKER_04] So they were working for the news since we have our own news station.

132
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:18,892
[SPEAKER_04] We have at least 100 viewers.

133
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:22,656
[SPEAKER_04] Sometimes it gets out to my peoples in North Carolina I used to work with.

134
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:24,358
[SPEAKER_04] I've taught at that for a few years.

135
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:27,142
[SPEAKER_04] So they love, they will do anything they want to do.

136
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:30,287
[SPEAKER_04] So I hold that further ahead.

137
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:33,171
[SPEAKER_01] So is it like streamed?

138
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,393
[SPEAKER_01] Absolutely.

139
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:35,194
[SPEAKER_01] I don't think so.

140
00:10:35,214 --> 00:10:39,360
[SPEAKER_01] We have a, like we have a study class data, but it's like a take from it.

141
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,088
[SPEAKER_01] But a lot of our coordinated media, like the majority of our students don't have media release.

142
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:50,937
[SPEAKER_01] And so we started posting it, and then it was very quickly like, oh no, that child's not supposed to be on there.

143
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:55,003
[SPEAKER_01] And so we just share it in the morning on Fridays.

144
00:10:55,543 --> 00:10:59,188
[SPEAKER_01] No, I'm just saying that that kind of irrigation, there's got to be that.

145
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,332
[SPEAKER_01] And it's, they will do anything to get in front of them.

146
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,854
[SPEAKER_04] As long as they don't get a release.

147
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,917
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, as long as they don't leave.

148
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:08,000
[SPEAKER_01] They'll do anything except get their mom to sign the release.

149
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,322
[SPEAKER_01] I think that would be a good idea.

150
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:11,345
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I had to go through the whole get the release.

151
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,067
[SPEAKER_00] Maybe you could use it as a push this year though.

152
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:14,248
[SPEAKER_01] Yes, yeah.

153
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:20,637
[SPEAKER_01] Our arts media teacher really said she wants to push that this year with the parents on the way in.

154
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:26,368
[SPEAKER_01] Your kid cannot participate in any of the things we do with the media first unless they have the real estate.

155
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:33,362
[SPEAKER_04] And we send out a permission form and then the parents sign in all this stuff.

156
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:40,296
[SPEAKER_04] And what a problem that happens is other teachers in the school start seeing their kids in right now.

157
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:51,421
[SPEAKER_05] And I'm like the principal gave y'all permission to be in a club, so that's not on me.

158
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:55,145
[SPEAKER_05] If y'all get something, that's someone else's.

159
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:59,851
[SPEAKER_04] It's my studio, but you wanna try it?

160
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,633
[SPEAKER_04] Anyway, but yeah, that's what I do.

161
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:04,596
[SPEAKER_04] That's what I do with the club and the piercings.

162
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:06,739
[SPEAKER_04] STEM does a lot more.

163
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:13,886
[SPEAKER_04] We do photography, we have a lot of cameras that we got some friends for.

164
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:19,171
[SPEAKER_04] We do, we do sphero, we do drones, we have those.

165
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:26,839
[SPEAKER_04] We do sometimes, we have, we have data data outside and count the laps we walk on track.

166
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,303
[SPEAKER_03] Which is really just to get them out of the classroom.

167
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:34,566
[SPEAKER_04] Well, so, it's very interesting, but,

168
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:50,609
[SPEAKER_01] I want to say five years ago to do first realize to choose and it was like And then they were like, okay, we gave you a mixture and like great good luck, which you know what?

169
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,232
[SPEAKER_01] Apparently not enough to maintain a program.

170
00:12:53,252 --> 00:13:00,182
[SPEAKER_01] We just think it right The first program has a lot of really cool coding resources and

171
00:13:00,162 --> 00:13:15,217
[SPEAKER_01] It's pricey, but the scale down for the C6 and 7th version is called Lego League, and it's Lego.

172
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:22,804
[SPEAKER_01] And so they code online, and then you just attach the motors to Lego cars instead of action.

173
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,647
[SPEAKER_01] I'm trying to find a picture of what the

174
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:32,576
[SPEAKER_04] On top of that, Sphero has that, it's called like the STEM kit.

175
00:13:32,837 --> 00:13:37,042
[SPEAKER_04] It costs a few thousand dollars.

176
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:40,947
[SPEAKER_04] It has those things she mentioned, those motors.

177
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:44,912
[SPEAKER_04] The kids are like in the book, and the book has a manual for it.

178
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:49,879
[SPEAKER_04] They have lessons and tasks where they deal with certain things.

179
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:57,533
[SPEAKER_01] So this is like the high school version, they're huge.

180
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:07,632
[SPEAKER_01] But if you do the Lego League, it's like you can put them on this table and drive them around and you just, we used, when we did it, we used like PS5 controllers.

181
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:15,092
[SPEAKER_04] The kids are very comfortable with this.

182
00:14:15,132 --> 00:14:20,406
[SPEAKER_00] So we've been talking, so you all have ideas about a potential unit for this year.

183
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:26,961
[SPEAKER_04] I would have known, but they just met you.

184
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,586
[SPEAKER_04] And said, hey, we just got your thing signed.

185
00:14:30,447 --> 00:14:32,451
[SPEAKER_04] But we just now noticed that your thing was in here.

186
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,393
[SPEAKER_04] It's my bad.

187
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,238
[SPEAKER_04] You still want to come in?

188
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,802
[SPEAKER_04] And I was in Alabama when I met you.

189
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:40,445
[SPEAKER_04] I'm like, OK.

190
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:41,888
[SPEAKER_04] That's when I get home.

191
00:14:41,868 --> 00:14:54,325
[SPEAKER_01] I really like to do something with the water cycle or weather with my sixth graders this year.

192
00:14:54,862 --> 00:15:00,072
[SPEAKER_04] So what that means is you want to do that.

193
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:03,118
[SPEAKER_04] What are you doing?

194
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:13,377
[SPEAKER_00] So I'm still working with our urban loose program as well and so all of science is my jam anyway so this part of nature is part of our place and so

195
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:16,560
[SPEAKER_00] I wouldn't, so I have access to be able to work with both of those.

196
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,563
[SPEAKER_00] So I think we can work this out.

197
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:27,932
[SPEAKER_00] And I think it even goes with the picture that Deborah painted down there about how they show the waterfall trickling on down to the community.

198
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:33,258
[SPEAKER_00] And so the waterfall and then the community.

199
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:35,280
[SPEAKER_00] It's a unit.

200
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,742
[SPEAKER_00] And so there's multiple lessons.

201
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:41,727
[SPEAKER_02] So we can just push in our thinking to be on task.

202
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:44,393
[SPEAKER_00] That's all.

203
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:45,894
[SPEAKER_00] What are your thoughts?

204
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:50,779
[SPEAKER_01] You could do something with your TV class.

205
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:55,484
[SPEAKER_01] You could do just identifying things on boards.

206
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:56,966
[SPEAKER_04] Predict the weather or report the weather.

207
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:58,468
[SPEAKER_01] Both.

208
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:00,270
[SPEAKER_01] We're about to learn about that, too, in general.

209
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:06,356
[SPEAKER_01] You could have a team that just predicts the weather, and then they write the forecast for the six months that it came down.

210
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,378
[SPEAKER_04] Those are the database responses.

211
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,760
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, we can do that.

212
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,523
[SPEAKER_04] I wish I had my computer, type seven, whatever.

213
00:16:12,503 --> 00:16:16,810
[SPEAKER_00] It's okay, and I think we can get those notes.

214
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:23,501
[SPEAKER_00] I want to just show y'all the weather rule that John is going to show you.

215
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:36,081
[SPEAKER_00] Then just give me a reason to really teach it because I learned about it last year, but I did not make time to teach, but if we create that it's part of our unit, then definitely.

216
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:41,710
[SPEAKER_04] I'm trying to look for my garden, so I can kind of tell you, show you how they do it.

217
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,992
[SPEAKER_00] This is my last year here.

218
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:45,635
[SPEAKER_00] This is the video.

219
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:48,679
[SPEAKER_00] So this is kind of like his report.

220
00:16:50,301 --> 00:17:00,154
[SPEAKER_00] But he does his wheel, where everything is, I guess, once the data is gathered, then he aligns everything here.

221
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:06,102
[SPEAKER_00] But he uses, hold on.

222
00:17:06,453 --> 00:17:09,458
[SPEAKER_00] this little reporting sheet to get the data.

223
00:17:10,398 --> 00:17:19,694
[SPEAKER_00] So he'll do this in the morning and then once he gets the data come back and put it all on the wheel and it gives him like the weather report for the day.

224
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:31,212
[SPEAKER_00] And there's a whole packet and everything so it's like a lot to learn but we can like one of our standards in sixth grade is the weather but then it's like

225
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:32,474
[SPEAKER_01] Cool.

226
00:17:32,735 --> 00:17:40,169
[SPEAKER_01] I know what degrees it is, and I know what the humidity is, and I know what the humidity is, but what does that actually tell me about anything?

227
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:47,884
[SPEAKER_01] Or how to read it, or how to just get in the data, or how to prepare for tomorrow based on what the weather is like today.

228
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:53,474
[SPEAKER_04] Like we wonder why I still wear shorts and t-shirts when I know it's going to be thunderstorms.

229
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:57,901
[SPEAKER_04] I get shocked if I do that in my room.

230
00:17:57,921 --> 00:18:02,329
[SPEAKER_01] Listen, I had a footsteps on this going into 9th grade this year.

231
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,595
[SPEAKER_01] And that was like the biggest thing that we've thought about in the last year.

232
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,438
[SPEAKER_01] Did he say something?

233
00:18:07,778 --> 00:18:10,623
[SPEAKER_01] He doesn't, like, why are you wearing a hoodie?

234
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:13,348
[SPEAKER_00] That's a thing, this generational thing right now.

235
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,892
[SPEAKER_04] It is, and it's stupid, but it's what I'm doing.

236
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:19,177
[SPEAKER_00] And I'm just like, well, thanks.

237
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:25,166
[SPEAKER_00] It's not just that they're comfortable, and they're like, man, this is what you're doing.

238
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:28,992
[SPEAKER_00] They're really beautiful, pretty.

239
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:29,633
[SPEAKER_00] And safe.

240
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,036
[SPEAKER_00] Safety, I think, is the thing.

241
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:35,221
[SPEAKER_01] I think that's really what it was.

242
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:35,682
[SPEAKER_01] Safety.

243
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:38,847
[SPEAKER_04] I needed to be able to hide.

244
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,830
[SPEAKER_01] Well, next year, he won't be at my school anymore.

245
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,492
[SPEAKER_04] He's going to high school, so.

246
00:18:42,472 --> 00:18:52,617
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's

247
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,295
[SPEAKER_05] Okay.

248
00:18:55,516 --> 00:19:00,265
[SPEAKER_00] You set everything up and everything?

249
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,452
[SPEAKER_04] Well, that's where the Knoxville Garden Alliance, they come in and help with that.

250
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,017
[SPEAKER_04] Then we have some other teachers that help.

251
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:08,341
[SPEAKER_04] My mom, she will help if she feels like it.

252
00:19:08,863 --> 00:19:09,163
[SPEAKER_04] Okay.

253
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,967
[SPEAKER_04] She feels like her retirement.

254
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:14,554
[SPEAKER_04] She wants to get out of retirement for a few hours.

255
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:22,774
[SPEAKER_03] Yeah, that's pretty much, I think that's a little more recent.

256
00:19:22,854 --> 00:19:31,395
[SPEAKER_04] And so with that, and they did, we did soil samples, we did all that kind of testing, pH levels.

257
00:19:31,645 --> 00:19:37,833
[SPEAKER_01] So Jen's gonna do, tomorrow we're doing aquatic water testing stuff.

258
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:42,319
[SPEAKER_01] And then maybe that'll give us some more ideas also about.

259
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:43,941
[SPEAKER_01] And we're gonna do the weather stuff.

260
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:49,248
[SPEAKER_01] But Jen's gonna take us on the side and give us water quality testing kits.

261
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:57,619
[SPEAKER_01] Just trying to think about like, there's a lot of different stuff in computer science in sixth grade science that you can collect data on.

262
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,263
[SPEAKER_01] But then it's like, what would the advocates do with it, is what I keep thinking about.

263
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:03,906
[SPEAKER_01] So that'll be neat to go and see how you do that.

264
00:20:04,147 --> 00:20:05,048
[SPEAKER_00] And that's fine.

265
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:05,728
[SPEAKER_00] That's organic.

266
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:07,570
[SPEAKER_00] We can develop it as we go along.

267
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,772
[SPEAKER_00] It's something we can find out.

268
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:09,733
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

269
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,096
[SPEAKER_01] Test the water.

270
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:15,299
[SPEAKER_00] And it's exciting that we're all going to get kids.

271
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,722
[SPEAKER_00] It's just as simple.

272
00:20:17,782 --> 00:20:21,126
[SPEAKER_00] It's like they're like little dipsticks to do.

273
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:23,469
[SPEAKER_00] quite different element testing.

274
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:27,434
[SPEAKER_00] But if we're going to have the same materials in, we can definitely kind of.

275
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:36,146
[SPEAKER_02] And if you think that if it's something you want to use, with the $100 project credit in this case, you can purchase it.

276
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:36,967
[SPEAKER_01] It's pretty cheap.

277
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,891
[SPEAKER_01] And if you're in Knoxville, you can get them from K-Test.

278
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:42,475
[SPEAKER_03] K-TEST are free next to Birmingham.

279
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:45,439
[SPEAKER_03] Yeah, they'll even come to your class and co-teach with you.

280
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,042
[SPEAKER_03] And they're all like grad students and scientists.

281
00:20:48,022 --> 00:20:54,853
[SPEAKER_04] So I'm guessing that pricing stuff that the Knoxville Garden Line has probably done with them, I would say.

282
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:57,838
[SPEAKER_04] Because they've already come to teach the kids with me.

283
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:03,888
[SPEAKER_04] They're supposed to teach and I just supervise the behavior.

284
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,132
[SPEAKER_02] It's great having them because...

285
00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:09,274
[SPEAKER_02] They have like little scientific conversations with them.

286
00:21:09,294 --> 00:21:10,996
[SPEAKER_02] And then the kids love the one-on-one.

287
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:12,679
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah, maybe they're still worse.

288
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,903
[SPEAKER_05] I always love thinking about that.

289
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:21,994
[SPEAKER_00] It sounds about normal.

290
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:49,888
[SPEAKER_01] I know Jen and I, we're going to do something eventually.

291
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:58,479
[SPEAKER_01] We're gonna do something with the invasives.

292
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:02,884
[SPEAKER_01] Right, and so, so basically, this is viewed by one.

293
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,668
[SPEAKER_01] No, they told me I could still, I was like, I'm going to interview you.

294
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:09,413
[SPEAKER_01] They were like, it's okay, you can still do invasives.

295
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:12,096
[SPEAKER_01] Man, shoot.

296
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:15,104
[SPEAKER_01] He said we maybe sleep a lot during the first two months.

297
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:17,386
[SPEAKER_01] You're going to be so sleep deprived.

298
00:22:17,406 --> 00:22:18,547
[SPEAKER_01] You're not thinking about this.

299
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,349
[SPEAKER_01] No, Derek and I sleep in chips.

300
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,671
[SPEAKER_01] We take turns.

301
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:26,995
[SPEAKER_01] Are they already scrambling to figure out who's going to cover your thigh?

302
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,356
[SPEAKER_01] I know, I just told Nora to sleep.

303
00:22:28,536 --> 00:22:31,679
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, they're saying, that's why I was asking a lot of questions.

304
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,721
[SPEAKER_00] And you know, he was like, I don't know what I'm saying.

305
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:38,164
[SPEAKER_00] Saying I come up with something that I was already doable to perform when we were already dressed.

306
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:39,225
[SPEAKER_00] So this is just my first year.

307
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,047
[SPEAKER_00] I remember, whatever.

308
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,488
[SPEAKER_00] And so since you're

309
00:22:42,468 --> 00:23:00,122
[SPEAKER_00] I have never developed a lot of that stuff.

310
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:02,985
[SPEAKER_00] And it's like not as sustainable.

311
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:09,132
[SPEAKER_00] Like you just said yourself how the products and some of the stuff just don't work for what's happening in your home.

312
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:13,136
[SPEAKER_00] And so I'm starting out and designing my own process.

313
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:20,945
[SPEAKER_00] I have a lot of new ways so I can kind of, you know, I want even with like state mandates, I know how to please the state and do what I want.

314
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,528
[SPEAKER_04] I have a half just for teaching teachers.

315
00:23:23,508 --> 00:23:28,716
[SPEAKER_04] Well, I mean, I guess because what you teach, you kind of have to.

316
00:23:28,736 --> 00:23:29,958
[SPEAKER_04] I mean, I do, too.

317
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:36,429
[SPEAKER_00] I mean, I just like not to, you know, I just like to be able to prove why I need to keep my job, you know, so.

318
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:43,660
[SPEAKER_04] My pastor, he's my Lord, Amy, and he's, so we can see eye to eye.

319
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:50,474
[SPEAKER_04] And my mom goes to church, so my mom and him, they be ganging up on me.

320
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:50,935
[SPEAKER_03] Yes.

321
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:52,898
[SPEAKER_00] But yeah, you get it.

322
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:59,567
[SPEAKER_00] So is there like a project that you would like to have done by the end of the year that you'd like to use this temptation?

323
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:04,354
[SPEAKER_00] See if there's like something else that's affecting that mutation.

324
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:05,496
[SPEAKER_04] The idea is

325
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,024
[SPEAKER_04] is more so through a garden.

326
00:24:08,245 --> 00:24:13,683
[SPEAKER_00] I'm open for that because I'm in those spaces as well, so I'm able to integrate.

327
00:24:14,164 --> 00:24:16,853
[SPEAKER_04] So yeah, you never integrate that now, granted.

328
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:21,753
[SPEAKER_04] These three days that we're doing this, these are supposed to be my days to go in the classroom and actually get it together.

329
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:32,326
[SPEAKER_04] So, I guess with the way that you do the weather and all that, that could relate directly to the STEM.

330
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:35,910
[SPEAKER_04] Because STEM is a lot more than this, we do other things.

331
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:40,596
[SPEAKER_04] But depending on what you're trying to do with yours,

332
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:50,715
[SPEAKER_00] I really brought up the weather for Audrey because she was talking about the weather and the water cycle, so I brought up the wheel, but I'm open to learning and utilizing it.

333
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:55,885
[SPEAKER_00] There's something that affects all of us without it being a great skill for my kids and for me.

334
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:56,846
[SPEAKER_00] So I'm open.

335
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,408
[SPEAKER_00] We can use that.

336
00:24:58,428 --> 00:25:05,114
[SPEAKER_00] But don't feel like we're stuck in that department because I'm open.

337
00:25:07,717 --> 00:25:09,458
[SPEAKER_00] So you have a lot of resources.

338
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:10,520
[SPEAKER_00] So let's talk about that.

339
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,203
[SPEAKER_00] Like, what are you looking forward to using and doing?

340
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:17,086
[SPEAKER_00] And then maybe I could kind of try to handle that.

341
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:21,130
[SPEAKER_01] It doesn't specifically say it, but it was one of the things that we talked about.

342
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:25,270
[SPEAKER_05] previous year came to the STEM portion.

343
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:29,477
[SPEAKER_04] We have the garden, we have drones, so we'll be using the drone at some point.

344
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:39,773
[SPEAKER_04] We have, of course we do a lot of TV prevention, so those are three big focuses in the classroom.

345
00:25:39,853 --> 00:25:47,685
[SPEAKER_04] Yes, we got more Legos and all that stuff, we're gonna probably mess with those two, but I think that'd be more related to sixth grade computer science courses.

346
00:25:48,025 --> 00:25:50,509
[SPEAKER_04] Seventh grade is for that as well.

347
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:55,357
[SPEAKER_00] I like the TV production part too, so you could do something in there.

348
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:56,419
[SPEAKER_00] It's really very awesome.

349
00:25:56,439 --> 00:26:00,185
[SPEAKER_00] I like the unique period that you have for your kids to get them to participate.

350
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:11,704
[SPEAKER_04] And I think positive production can be a project in itself, but you are working with that because if we are producing new things, shows,

351
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:21,923
[SPEAKER_04] for the masses and we include your science critique, your computer science skills.

352
00:26:21,963 --> 00:26:26,412
[SPEAKER_04] They also intersect, but still, it'd be superior.

353
00:26:26,472 --> 00:26:30,680
[SPEAKER_03] It's not fair how we want to do that.

354
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,587
[SPEAKER_00] That's a good start of conversation.

355
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:39,251
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, it just, you know, just it's like, maybe I could do so much.

356
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,194
[SPEAKER_03] I just based on your findings.

357
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,055
[SPEAKER_04] I can see it though.

358
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:45,316
[SPEAKER_04] I love doing teen production.

359
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:50,421
[SPEAKER_00] I also have to do it from the app, from the phone, cameras.

360
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:51,502
[SPEAKER_00] So let's talk about that.

361
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:53,303
[SPEAKER_00] So teen production.

362
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:55,445
[SPEAKER_00] OK, so of course you have it in your show.

363
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:58,848
[SPEAKER_00] So I know you just talked about the new type of show you have for your school.

364
00:26:59,348 --> 00:27:00,229
[SPEAKER_04] G&A.

365
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:04,573
[SPEAKER_04] I can like label the trees.

366
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:05,836
[SPEAKER_00] What all does it cover?

367
00:27:06,076 --> 00:27:07,540
[SPEAKER_04] What all does it cover?

368
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,107
[SPEAKER_04] The basic news, sports, weather.

369
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:16,319
[SPEAKER_02] Maybe, this is an idea, because I have to get this done in nine weeks.

370
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:22,933
[SPEAKER_04] And then sometimes we'll have like specials on.

371
00:27:22,913 --> 00:27:32,532
[SPEAKER_04] We have a ball game today, they have a meeting release, we have some clips of the game, you know, and stuff with our admins.

372
00:27:32,613 --> 00:27:35,418
[SPEAKER_04] But that's usually the grand scheme of things.

373
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:42,272
[SPEAKER_04] But we want to do more about things like you said, weather, stuff that

374
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:58,877
[SPEAKER_04] Especially if we learn how to do the weather.

375
00:27:58,857 --> 00:28:02,321
[SPEAKER_00] All right, so we could share our rhythm report.

376
00:28:02,341 --> 00:28:16,315
[SPEAKER_01] And even if every student doesn't have a rhythm release, or even if you didn't have a TV program, you could still do a podcast, have your students script a podcast, or have them write in scripted interviews.

377
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:26,045
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah, we have kids that don't have, we have them in the interviews of the ones that are actually students.

378
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:28,527
[SPEAKER_04] Or they collected that, those ones behind the scenes,

379
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:55,560
[SPEAKER_01] more strict this year

380
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:15,895
[SPEAKER_05] No, we're gonna go ahead and get this mini release form.

381
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,558
[SPEAKER_00] Do y'all do any point system?

382
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:19,401
[SPEAKER_00] Do y'all have like a house system or anything?

383
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:20,643
[SPEAKER_00] Like incentive basis?

384
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:22,085
[SPEAKER_00] Any incentives?

385
00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:24,609
[SPEAKER_04] Um, incentives for doing it?

386
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,731
[SPEAKER_00] I'm just like anything.

387
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:29,738
[SPEAKER_00] Like you could use a... Yeah, give a point for bringing it back.

388
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,162
[SPEAKER_00] I give a grade.

389
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:33,957
[SPEAKER_00] You need some points.

390
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:36,683
[SPEAKER_00] Points push behavior.

391
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:37,786
[SPEAKER_00] Give a teacher leverage.

392
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:38,908
[SPEAKER_04] Snacks.

393
00:29:39,189 --> 00:29:41,333
[SPEAKER_04] But the problem is that, the snacks.

394
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:44,600
[SPEAKER_00] See, points lead up to snacks and you don't have to give them every time.

395
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:47,046
[SPEAKER_00] So you gotta leverage the points.

396
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:47,908
[SPEAKER_00] Right?

397
00:29:47,928 --> 00:29:48,349
[SPEAKER_00] And then it.

398
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,874
[SPEAKER_04] Do you want me to like grade points or?

399
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:59,112
[SPEAKER_00] I use like Dojo, but like some people have house systems like where like kids belong to this group and like they earn points or like they're
