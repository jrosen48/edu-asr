1
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:09,065
We're all within our group back on the trail.

2
00:00:10,146 --> 00:00:17,093
You heard that I am not outdoorsy, but I am a gardener.

3
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,096
Kind of crazy, isn't it?

4
00:00:20,217 --> 00:00:22,259
But if you find your niche, you just start to roll with it.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,081
I'm no hiker, though.

6
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:28,170
Hiking is not my life, but hiking is a great thing to do.

7
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:35,100
Everyone can find small trails, short trails, or you can be a biker and bike on trails that are for bikes only.

8
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,811
I think we're coming to our first checkpoint.

9
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:43,612
We have a traffic jam.

10
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:50,001
Always a traffic jam, that's what we're going to call it.

11
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,572
We see more out here.

12
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:04,255
A lot of nice looking forestry.

13
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,920
That is definitely worth gandering at.

14
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:13,683
We have a ride out tree trunk right here.

15
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:16,685
That has long since been gone.

16
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:21,349
We are now crossing up the rocks and going to our checkpoint.

17
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:23,631
Reach.

18
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:28,155
What do you guys see in this area that might have been different than your hike up?

19
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:32,545
Is there anything else?

20
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,067
Berries.

21
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:34,828
Okay, berries.

22
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:36,289
Let's focus.

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,234
We have this area of observation over here.

24
00:01:40,374 --> 00:01:41,396
You can even see up there.

25
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:47,363
It continues on the sides, but we want you to focus on this little berry right here.

26
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:48,985
There's one there.

27
00:01:49,185 --> 00:01:53,891
And then you guys are going to try to notice the difference.

28
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,254
It's got two.

29
00:01:56,834 --> 00:01:57,315
Yes.

30
00:01:57,447 --> 00:02:00,773
So what do you think is those two points?

31
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:01,795
Like what is it from?

32
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:06,744
And what could possibly be unique about that berry besides the two points?

33
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:19,827
Well it could be from... What do fruit produce?

34
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:20,539
Seeds.

35
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,202
Okay, so how many seeds do you think might be inside?

36
00:02:23,323 --> 00:02:24,184
Two.

37
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:24,444
Two.

38
00:02:24,464 --> 00:02:26,227
Okay, and question?

39
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,051
So how do you think it came to be that berry?

40
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,754
Like what would create that berry?

41
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:33,817
Like how would it be reproduced?

42
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,261
With the egg and the sperm.

43
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:39,085
A flower, okay.

44
00:02:39,165 --> 00:02:46,194
So if there's two seeds, double fertilization like two eggs and two sperm.

45
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:46,675
So two

46
00:02:47,296 --> 00:03:09,237
two flowers yeah two flowers and you can taste it it's edible and it's just kind of like it tastes like air yeah you're not gonna get nutrients from it i've eaten them before i don't need to eat them again it tastes like um you can find the citrusy air taste the two seeds though they are two seeds yeah and you can like individually like pop it out immediately

47
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,339
Yep.

48
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,041
And it's called Partridge Berry.

49
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:13,223
Partridge Berry.

50
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:16,046
So it looks like the next group's coming up.

51
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:17,609
That was all we had for you guys.

52
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:18,750
Thank you so much.

53
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:19,852
We loved it.

54
00:03:20,272 --> 00:03:21,414
Yes.

55
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,616
Do you all want this back?

56
00:03:22,656 --> 00:03:23,256
There you go.

57
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:24,478
It's all yours.

58
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:30,286
It's not snack time yet.

59
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,107
Up the trail we go.

60
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,489
That was the first checkpoint.

61
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,675
And as we walk, we're going to look at the

62
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:42,144
downhill, you can hear the river, the waterway.

63
00:03:42,865 --> 00:03:46,991
I'm not going to walk that far down because I could topple and I don't have insurance that can cover all that.

64
00:03:48,172 --> 00:03:51,817
So we're going to continue to trek uphill with my partners.

65
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:01,931
As you see over here, you see all the greenery that is being shown or being produced by nature.

66
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:06,257
We see some pine

67
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,735
Can you say a pine tree or something close to that?

68
00:04:09,755 --> 00:04:11,318
That is up here.

69
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:24,018
That is not quite your Christmas tree, but you know, it could be something to take home if you so choose to.

70
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:26,783
But you have to hike to get it.

71
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:32,211
We have this interesting tree right here.

72
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,455
It looks like a twig, a tall twig.

73
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:38,880
It strikes your imagination.

74
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,722
Look at that imagination.

75
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:40,002
Look at.

76
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:50,742
Now we're getting to our second checkpoint as we cross the threshold of this trail.

77
00:04:59,438 --> 00:04:59,498
OK.

78
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:03,884
We need you to touch this leaf and tell us what you feel.

79
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,647
It's a sensory station.

80
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:07,128
Yes.

81
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:07,889
Sensory station.

82
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:08,630
It's so soft.

83
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:10,112
It is soft.

84
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:11,594
It's like a silk blanket.

85
00:05:11,614 --> 00:05:12,375
There you go.

86
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,498
This is, there's so much better than the other group.

87
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:15,879
They're very indirect.

88
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,020
Yeah.

89
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,882
They said it was a sensory.

90
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,205
It's all about our delivery.

91
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:21,907
But the underside is veiny.

92
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,209
Yeah.

93
00:05:25,752 --> 00:05:26,053
Okay.

94
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:27,915
What kind of tree does it remind you of?

95
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:34,596
Reminds me of a maple.

96
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:35,697
I almost thought aloe.

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,602
Oh, aloe's a good one.

98
00:05:39,623 --> 00:05:40,344
Because it's smooth.

99
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:41,326
Yes.

100
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:44,470
So you're right, maple, because it has these little guys.

101
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,895
I said tulip poplar because I didn't see these by the way she was holding it.

102
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,583
So that's a very special leaf you want to know how to locate.

103
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:54,727
It is indeed a maple.

104
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:56,169
It's a striped.

105
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,532
And how do we know?

106
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:03,201
Maple because on the bark there's these little stripe marks.

107
00:06:03,221 --> 00:06:09,512
And so it is a safe leaf that you need if you are in need.

108
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,881
It's the Charmin of the Woods.

109
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:14,185
Charmin of the Woods.

110
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,367
That's why you guys did so great.

111
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:15,968
For the toiletries.

112
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:22,318
You totally picked up on the fact that it was totally safe.

113
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,200
Excellent, excellent job.

114
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:25,983
And the Charmin is free.

115
00:06:26,043 --> 00:06:27,566
The Charmin is free.

116
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:29,328
The Charmin is free.

117
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,053
I'm all sweaty.

118
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:36,259
Nobody in there.

119
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:40,803
So we just found some Charmin in the forest.

120
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,066
It cost you nothing.

121
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:47,910
Just make sure you have some hand sanitizer afterwards.

122
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:54,896
Or maybe even some hand wipes, you know, to wipe it.

123
00:06:55,157 --> 00:06:56,017
Maybe a little shovel.

124
00:06:56,057 --> 00:06:56,978
A little shovel too.

125
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,124
So you can distance yourself from the scent both

126
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:27,154
never mind cut edit restart you see where this fell down yeah and all this is new like all this is all this quick growing that has popped up yeah

127
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,416
Just because it topples is that does not mean it will not be an asset to nature.

128
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:35,116
That's right.

129
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,641
All these these become nurse logs.

130
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:40,383
Mm hmm.

131
00:07:40,403 --> 00:07:40,924
You get stuck.

132
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:41,905
They're already doing it.

133
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,688
They've already got mushrooms all over.

134
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:57,023
My father in law is 60 and he was tied up with an extension

135
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,326
We're coming to our third checkpoint, I do believe.

136
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:06,914
After we looked at this nice set of toppled trees and whatnot.

137
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:11,921
Lots of downed trees.

138
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,907
These are really big leaves.

139
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:19,069
Why would a plant have really big leaves?

140
00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:20,051
To get more sun.

141
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:26,098
Maybe because it's diffused light and it has to spread itself out to get light.

142
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:40,324
And like the stems are not woody and kind of light so they're probably quick to grow, fast to grow.

143
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:46,152
So we've got some other plants that there are a lot of.

144
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:49,477
Could it not also be a... Mushrooms are not plants.

145
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:53,242
They're actually a... Fungus.

146
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:55,565
A heterotroph as opposed to an autotroph.

147
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:55,685
Okay.

148
00:08:55,705 --> 00:08:58,549
We're more closely related to fungi than plants are.

149
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,784
Wouldn't these plants serve as food for animals, too?

150
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:02,846
They would, for sure.

151
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:07,012
But we've got a lot of one type of plant growing in this area.

152
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:09,637
These little hourglassy things?

153
00:09:09,657 --> 00:09:11,219
Yeah, these little hourglassy things.

154
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,905
That's a tulip poplar.

155
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:17,750
A tulip poplar, which is also apparently the state tree of Tennessee.

156
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:19,272
Did not know that.

157
00:09:20,534 --> 00:09:23,980
I think I've been told that before.

158
00:09:24,652 --> 00:09:25,553
And they get big.

159
00:09:25,593 --> 00:09:26,414
They get huge.

160
00:09:26,434 --> 00:09:26,894
They do.

161
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,476
There's actually a few of them right over there.

162
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:32,040
I believe that's one right behind Jen.

163
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:50,659
They are early on the succession list because they are fast growing with those nice broad leaves for lots of energy harnessing.

164
00:09:52,715 --> 00:10:19,667
energy or sorry photosynthetic energy is uh they're very good at harvesting photosynthetic energy because of their large leaves there we go yes there's a coherent thought you hear that camera thank you a really big one of those things that we yeah those are the broadleaf plantain thank you appreciation

165
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:23,726
Do you know that bird?

166
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,627
I do not know that bird.

167
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:28,290
It's the loudest bird in the forest.

168
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,971
The Carolina Wren.

169
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,372
It's a what again?

170
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:31,493
Carolina Wren.

171
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,114
Oh, a Carolina Wren.

172
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:37,759
I call it the loudest bird in the forest because it is.

173
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:38,359
Look how little.

174
00:10:43,324 --> 00:10:43,404
Hmm.

175
00:10:43,424 --> 00:10:44,445
Making that big old noise.

176
00:10:46,547 --> 00:10:49,890
Had some big lungs, I guess, that we can't see something.

177
00:10:54,764 --> 00:11:16,791
So this section of the trail, what sort of new thing caught your eye as you were walking up?

178
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:18,373
Like a little white mushroom.

179
00:11:19,775 --> 00:11:20,676
That's the thing.

180
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:21,497
Okay.

181
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:38,558
so we were tasked with having you guys find the beginning middle and end of the life cycle of this mushroom yeah okay and you find it in three different cycles if it's fruiting life so

182
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:46,176
Some of them are round and closed and some of them are open.

183
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:48,380
Is the opening part a phase?

184
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:50,783
Is that the final phase?

185
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:52,126
Here's an open one.

186
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,530
This is closed and that one's open.

187
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:58,276
Yeah, but then I think... There's a medium.

188
00:11:58,596 --> 00:12:01,561
Yeah, so that's the end phase and the closed is the beginning.

189
00:12:01,581 --> 00:12:04,005
What do you think the middle phase would look like then?

190
00:12:06,652 --> 00:12:31,748
a little bit open yeah say it again this is the middle stage no this is the beginning beginning and then that's the end more like the end phases what would be the middle phase like this one right here with a little open i think that's a bug hole i think

191
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:32,726
A what?

192
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:33,347
A buckle?

193
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:35,230
A bug hole?

194
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,174
You know bug holes?

195
00:12:38,815 --> 00:12:39,917
You know bug holes?

196
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:41,940
They're like muggles except bugles.

197
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,062
I thought you said buckle.

198
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:44,304
In the bug hole.

199
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,766
The bug hole?

200
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:46,567
No.

201
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:48,610
I don't see one.

202
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:50,293
Do you see one that's different than those?

203
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:56,092
So I kind of feel like this one is a middle phase.

204
00:12:56,113 --> 00:12:58,797
See how it's kind of starting to go a little more translucent.

205
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,421
Oh and it's not quite as open.

206
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,384
It doesn't have those ruffly edges.

207
00:13:03,725 --> 00:13:04,065
Right.

208
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:06,109
Cool.

209
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:14,222
And then we were also asked as you were looking what's one unique thing about this mushroom than other mushrooms you observed.

210
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:21,817
Where is it growing as grouped together as some?

211
00:13:21,837 --> 00:13:28,926
Okay, so more individual, not quite as clustered.

212
00:13:29,006 --> 00:13:35,214
Isn't this a small cluster right here of them?

213
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:37,296
You may pass.

214
00:13:37,396 --> 00:13:42,543
That's where I discovered them.

215
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:45,306
They look thinner too.

216
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,390
Well, looks like they're small clusters, though, like here.

217
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:48,951
Yeah.

218
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:49,471
Mm hmm.

219
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:53,257
Fascinating.

220
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:54,058
Thank you all.

221
00:13:54,138 --> 00:13:55,059
Thank you for the lesson.

222
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,073
So that was checkpoint, I think, three or four.

223
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,775
I'm starting to lose count.

224
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:06,989
but it's all good.

225
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:27,711
But we just learned about some mushrooms and the stages at what, uh, what they're in stage one, stage two or stage three and how they look at each stage, which is very interesting and mind boggling at the same time.

226
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,834
Ooh, look all the campground down there.

227
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:32,016
That's what that is.

228
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:43,371
There's a campground down there, it looks like, where you can put a tent up and enjoy safely, of course.

229
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,317
Oh, let me catch up.

230
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:01,497
All right, y'all.

231
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:01,637
Hello.

232
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:01,777
Hello.

233
00:15:01,797 --> 00:15:01,917
Hello.

234
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:02,458
Your station in this city.

235
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:33,508
you are going to be sharing with lots of ferns around you're going to be sharing about this particular fern right here if you already know it hold it hold your tongue um what do you all notice about this fern there's some here you can look at it you can feel it pay particular attention to the shape that's a different one that's the kind that she's looking at right there

236
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,951
See the difference here?

237
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:35,812
I do.

238
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:49,306
If you were a scientist and you were already given a scientific name but you were charged with giving it a common name, what would you name this fern and why?

239
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,056
I might name it something having to do with a comb because it looks like a comb to me.

240
00:15:59,517 --> 00:16:02,500
Okay, the comb fern.

241
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:30,850
um it almost looks like a tree like some of the shapes it is something like a tree i don't know what its actual common name is given to by some random person so the actual common name of this fern is the christmas fern so on to your point some people are like oh it looks like a christmas tree yeah another reason i've heard is that if you turn the fern horizontally

242
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:37,884
that the little leaves look like stockings hanging from the mantle on a fireplace.

243
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:50,425
So your task is to have people notice, wonder about the fern, give it their own common name, and then you can share its real name and a little bit about the history of, well, one reason why.

244
00:16:50,523 --> 00:17:15,771
all right have fun make it your own there's also just i just noticed there's also about a year a skinny yearling bear right down there he's just drinking at the stream he's in the trees oh yeah it's like a big dog is it coming up here

245
00:17:16,308 --> 00:17:21,876
Do we have a dog, a bow horn?

246
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:38,400
He's not going to want to have anything to do with us if we make a lot of noise.

247
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:50,627
Hey, Bear.

248
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:53,230
You're beautiful.

249
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:53,771
Go away.

250
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:00,560
Go on now.

251
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,241
We love you.

252
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:04,044
Stay away from people.

253
00:22:04,064 --> 00:22:05,486
Good choices.

254
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:08,670
Good choices.

255
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:37,022
I didn't see you there.

256
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:37,543
Come on now, we love you.

257
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:47,716
Okay, wow.

258
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:50,879
All right, I forgot I had my binoculars.

259
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:52,700
I've got my binoculars right here.

260
00:22:53,061 --> 00:22:53,942
This is not my station.

261
00:22:53,962 --> 00:23:01,609
If you can just keep an eye and make sure they don't come back this way, then people can look at it as they are coming up the trail too.

262
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:14,601
If it starts coming up the hill, we're going to yell at it to go away.

263
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:22,763
So I guess we taught our lesson, didn't we?

264
00:23:22,883 --> 00:23:25,105
Who's ready for a fern lesson?

265
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:26,587
Who's our group?

266
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:28,469
We are.

267
00:23:28,489 --> 00:23:30,892
How old is that bear, though?

268
00:23:31,052 --> 00:23:32,113
A little bit, it's okay.

269
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:32,694
Go for it.

270
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,316
Now do it.

271
00:23:34,776 --> 00:23:36,558
When do you get to be a fern?

272
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,080
You can see ferns all the time.

273
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,302
We'll teach you really quickly and then you can go.

274
00:23:53,647 --> 00:23:54,708
to it.

275
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:55,389
But they do.

276
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:59,835
But it's okay.

277
00:24:00,716 --> 00:24:09,747
Because we're protected.

278
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,291
Maybe.

279
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:17,317
It's the root dance.

280
00:24:17,437 --> 00:24:18,278
Exciting.

281
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,922
Where's his mom?

282
00:24:20,982 --> 00:24:21,983
Where's his mom?

283
00:24:22,537 --> 00:24:25,588
Let's not figure that out.

284
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:29,963
I just want to keep my eyes open, just in case.

285
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:34,037
Would you all like a little lesson?

286
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:34,639
Sure.

287
00:24:36,593 --> 00:24:37,514
Are you out of the first three?

288
00:24:37,534 --> 00:24:38,956
No, you're not.

289
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:40,678
You don't know where to go, huh?

290
00:24:40,698 --> 00:24:42,240
No, not a long way.

291
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:43,923
I don't know how long.

292
00:24:43,963 --> 00:24:46,226
So don't we teach them the lesson and they teach it to the next person?

293
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:47,587
No, no, we stay here.

294
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:52,153
And then we come up, they go on and we stay here.

295
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:55,257
So we're looking at ferns.

296
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:58,902
And there are a couple of ferns in this area.

297
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,787
We're particularly looking for one that looks like this.

298
00:25:03,408 --> 00:25:07,934
Up here those are a little different you see the difference in them.

299
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:22,192
Yeah, so if you were a scientist And you were gonna come up with a common name For that fern I want you to look at it and look at its characteristics and see if you can figure out What you might?

300
00:25:23,114 --> 00:25:24,415
Name it Christmas tree.

301
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:27,319
Why do you say Christmas tree the shape?

302
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,343
And where do you see the shape like?

303
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:43,978
in the overall strand that's what i was looking at or a fan or a palm oh feather palm that's a good one fan feather palm

304
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:45,503
OK, those are both good.

305
00:25:46,164 --> 00:25:49,488
Do you know what that fern is actually called?

306
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:52,431
I mean, I don't know the scientific names.

307
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:54,133
Furnace, furnace.

308
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,654
Yes, exactly.

309
00:25:56,135 --> 00:26:00,640
Many people call this a Christmas fern because of the reason you said.

310
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:08,968
And also, some people think these little individual petals look like a stocking on the mantle.

311
00:26:09,008 --> 00:26:12,312
Nice.

312
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:40,459
okay because like at the bottom there's a little there's a little heel in the bottom and so that's how i can tell them the difference between these two i don't know all the ferns but i know that one and there's another fern called a maiden hair fern where the ferns are like in a little wreath like a fairy might wear around her head so i can remember those easily well if you want to stay and bear you're welcome if you want to move on you're also welcome to do that

313
00:26:40,574 --> 00:26:42,638
The bear is totally this round.

314
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:44,421
I know, right?

315
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:45,363
Yes.

316
00:26:45,624 --> 00:26:49,030
I figured we were that literally every one right here.

317
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,198
I kind of think we was going to stay here by ourselves with this bear, but never mind.

318
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:54,921
Ann would keep us safe.

319
00:26:56,032 --> 00:26:57,574
I love that you think that's true.

320
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:00,978
All I know how to do is yell great things at the bear about itself.

321
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,560
That seemed to work.

322
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,641
I learned that from the Rangers.

323
00:27:03,941 --> 00:27:05,964
You don't have to say terrible, horrible things in the bear.

324
00:27:06,284 --> 00:27:07,946
It can't speak English, it turns out.

325
00:27:08,687 --> 00:27:10,469
You just have to discourage it with noise.

326
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:12,011
Turns out it doesn't know its name.

327
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,736
No, it just needs to stay away from people.

328
00:27:15,756 --> 00:27:17,638
You see the bear stood there, isn't he?

329
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:18,719
Still going away somewhere?

330
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,102
I talked all night about him shutting up for the next two.

331
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,123
OK.

332
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:24,486
Well, there we learned that these two did.

333
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:25,424
so they can go.

334
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:27,928
It graduated.

335
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:28,989
You have a degree.

336
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,134
Hi guys.

337
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:32,535
Hello.

338
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:33,416
Ferns.

339
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:33,957
Ferns.

340
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:39,906
So, um, as you see these ferns, you see this one in particular.

341
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:45,675
What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you see this beautiful fern?

342
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:52,966
It's got these nice little ridges, sharp leaves.

343
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:53,106
Okay.

344
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,606
They arch.

345
00:27:55,626 --> 00:27:56,628
They arch, all right.

346
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:05,028
So if they do those things, what would be the name that you would give it based on what you just said?

347
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:06,752
Just a common name.

348
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:07,795
Doesn't have to be a Latin name.

349
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:08,556
Like someone's teeth.

350
00:28:09,158 --> 00:28:10,661
Reminds me of sawtooth.

351
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:12,225
Sawtooth fern?

352
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:16,592
Jaws fern.

353
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,173
Jaws fern.

354
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,536
Do you guys have any names?

355
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:21,358
Okay, looks like an arrow.

356
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,259
Arrow, yeah.

357
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:22,940
Okay, arrow.

358
00:28:24,682 --> 00:28:27,105
Especially this big one right here.

359
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,407
So can you tell that those are different?

360
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:29,228
Yeah.

361
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:32,071
Yeah, they're a different variety of fern.

362
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:34,794
And we're wanting to focus on just this one.

363
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:37,718
I mean, not that you were wrong, but like to notice the difference, right?

364
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:40,221
They would have different names, right?

365
00:28:41,872 --> 00:28:43,114
Do you want to propose a name?

366
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:44,858
Feather Fern.

367
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:46,781
That's nice.

368
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:48,284
Close.

369
00:28:48,565 --> 00:28:49,667
What is it?

370
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:50,128
Bird.

371
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:57,822
There's a holiday that you get out of school for a lot.

372
00:28:58,173 --> 00:28:59,515
It's kind of cold outside.

373
00:28:59,736 --> 00:29:01,098
There you go.

374
00:29:01,178 --> 00:29:02,059
Nice.

375
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,201
Because it looks like a Christmas tree.

376
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:04,223
Yes.

377
00:29:04,544 --> 00:29:08,390
And these individual leaves, some people say look like a stocking.

378
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,151
I can see that.

379
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,034
Like stockings.

380
00:29:11,054 --> 00:29:11,275
Yeah.

381
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:14,139
Because it has a little heel on the bottom there.

382
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,725
So it has like a Christmas vibe to it.

383
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:19,048
It's kind of a Christmas vibe.

384
00:29:19,068 --> 00:29:19,789
Christmas in July.

385
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,530
Yeah.

386
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,071
That's right.

387
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:21,512
Should we move?

388
00:29:21,532 --> 00:29:22,714
Thank you guys.

389
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:23,435
So you have passed.

390
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:24,737
You graduated.

391
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:30,186
I still have John's binoculars, but he's chasing the bear.

392
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:30,807
No camera?

393
00:29:31,028 --> 00:29:31,408
It died.

394
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,230
Again.

395
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,557
Sorry, we had some good blooper reels too.

396
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:37,541
So you didn't get to capture the bear down there?

397
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:37,921
No!

398
00:29:39,064 --> 00:29:39,304
Dang.

399
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:39,705
Well I did.

400
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:40,197
Good.

401
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:41,118
Footage.

402
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:46,244
Yes, I'm gonna sell it.

403
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:49,207
$5 per second for narration.

404
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:51,889
Well, come on up.

405
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:54,352
We're looking at some ferns up here.

406
00:29:54,893 --> 00:30:02,801
There's a couple different kinds of ferns out in here, and we're kind of focusing on these right in here.

407
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:08,967
So once you just take a look at them and see what kind of characteristics you see, how would you describe their leaves or their shape?

408
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:10,525
Flat.

409
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:15,192
Are they compound or simple?

410
00:30:15,212 --> 00:30:16,093
No, they've got to be.

411
00:30:18,857 --> 00:30:19,859
It's one stem.

412
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:24,826
So it looks like it's a multi-stem plant.

413
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,832
It's definitely got little serrated edges.

414
00:30:29,012 --> 00:30:29,453
Yeah.

415
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:45,012
So if you're the science guy who finds these out in nature and it's your job to give it a common name, what are you going to name it?

416
00:30:46,696 --> 00:30:47,357
Pointy plant.

417
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:51,263
Pointy plant.

418
00:30:51,283 --> 00:30:55,130
It looks more like a... It reminds me of a feather.

419
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:55,931
Yeah.

420
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:59,336
But it's not soft, but it reminds me of the shape of a feather.

421
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:07,930
Well, they are actually called Christmas ferns.

422
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,571
Oh, okay.

423
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:09,733
Yes.

424
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:18,286
can see kind of the shape of the Christmas tree but also some people think like if you turn it sideways it looks like little stockings hanging from the mantle.

425
00:31:19,308 --> 00:31:20,270
That's a stretch.

426
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:31,553
I mean maybe back in the days when people would hang socks like an actual sock rather than a stocking.

427
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:57,338
yeah because socks tend to hang more straight the stocking really has the heel right yeah yeah yeah you have to think old school yeah and that's all we have to teach you today is it edible not that i'm aware of does it have a smooth side and a fuzzy side

428
00:31:57,318 --> 00:32:13,504
You prevented me from my dad joke, which is everything's edible once.

429
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,802
Well, you all have graduated.

430
00:32:16,703 --> 00:32:32,503
We're going to have a bear delay is my prediction.

431
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:33,724
Yes.

432
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:40,773
It's going to be like 20 minutes before anyone else comes along.

433
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,495
I need everybody to share all their
