00:00:54.166 --> 00:01:10.764
In terms of data, firsthand data, how would you use those?

00:01:10.784 --> 00:01:11.866
Well, like we said, the place is where you are, right?

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:12.748
So place-based data or place-based lessons.

00:01:38.682 --> 00:02:03.137
Those are things we can find out.

00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:28.045
Ooh.

00:04:28.225 --> 00:04:31.249
using the language of probability.

00:10:51.355 --> 00:11:04.857
I was just gonna ask what is Spell Bayesian you keep using that word over and over and over.

00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:08.723
What is it like B IZ or B?

00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:48.644
Okay.

00:11:48.664 --> 00:11:49.045
Thank you.

00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:53.018
I totally had that spelled wrong.

00:11:53.038 --> 00:11:57.492
Yeah, I had no idea the word you were using.

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:55.310
Oh, it's so many pages.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:13:00.341
Do I have to put my name in?

00:13:00.361 --> 00:13:09.582
It's so many pages, bro.

00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:15.934
All included in her communication.

00:15:21.338 --> 00:15:27.096
Thank you.

00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:50.214
Well, the sticky note brainstorming thing we did out in the friendship circle and then dividing up, I mean, that was all included, heard in communication.

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:55.690
And then rearranging the sticky notes and all that good stuff.

00:17:10.469 --> 00:17:21.323
for themselves but also for me and we hang them on the board and we revisit them regularly and it's a lot easier for me to say like you said this is how you wanted to

00:18:34.523 --> 00:18:37.328
you're still talking about the interconnectedness between.

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:30.769
species here, right?

00:22:28.293 --> 00:22:35.940
Yes, biodiversity is necessary.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:26.362
And there's lots of places where we have people go out and we're paying to remove honeysuckle, or we are going out volunteering to remove honeysuckle, right?

00:23:26.902 --> 00:23:33.650
With our IB science juniors, we are working together with IAMS.

00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:36.833
And IAMS is focusing on bird scats.

00:23:37.134 --> 00:23:39.636
Is it really worth the time to remove all these invasives?

00:23:39.797 --> 00:23:40.778
Is it helping the birds?

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:41.679
Is it hurting the birds?

00:23:41.739 --> 00:23:42.900
What kind of biodiversity

00:23:57.292 --> 00:23:58.528
They all die.

00:27:07.287 --> 00:27:10.260
those to whatever standards you'd like if you want to use this exact same activity.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:36.854
be like, all right, who knows what this word means?

00:27:37.114 --> 00:27:38.337
Who knows what this word means, right?

00:27:38.357 --> 00:27:40.060
Because that's the objective.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:45.370
So then last year, with the mindset of Project Credible, I started to put a little bit more of this on the students.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.760
So more of them dissecting the objective and them modeling what they think this is going to look like.

00:28:45.668 --> 00:28:45.787
Thank you.

00:30:00.982 --> 00:30:03.290
Now go ahead and go to the second part.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.861
Join your shoulder partner or group mates and see if you came up with similar definitions.

00:30:07.042 --> 00:30:08.547
So just talk about what you wrote down.

00:30:09.249 --> 00:30:12.038
If you knew one that they didn't, then go ahead and talk to them about that.

00:30:50.442 --> 00:30:54.597
random, no plan pattern, systemic, no plan pattern.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:33.527
right looking for the beginning letter

00:31:39.683 --> 00:31:45.529
So go ahead and flip the paper, but try not to look at the adjoining page.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:46.931
I know that's silly.

00:31:46.951 --> 00:31:51.296
So just try and flip it and look at this one right here, where it says third, fourth, fifth.

00:31:53.358 --> 00:31:54.680
Don't look at the adjoining page.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.903
It's just there for the next step.

00:31:57.923 --> 00:32:00.166
So now third, fourth, fifth.

00:32:00.646 --> 00:32:03.109
And once again, we're doing this with our students.

00:35:06.554 --> 00:35:09.578
Yeah.

00:35:58.175 --> 00:36:01.550
to this exact same coordinate and look at this exact same spot.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:07.054
They could assess the biodiversity year after year and compare that to other places, right?

00:36:29.174 --> 00:36:30.517
up a little bit at the moment.

00:36:30.878 --> 00:36:48.178
So we're going to change it up just a little bit when we get outside, and we're actually going to decide what species we see the most of, and then we're going to classify those as A through B. So we all have like five species that are common, and then we're going to have

00:37:20.693 --> 00:37:23.700
Once again, this is just stuff I show my students on Canvas.

00:37:51.946 --> 00:37:52.948
at your objective again.

00:37:53.329 --> 00:37:57.539
So we are going to figure out, evaluate population abundance of non-modal species.

00:37:58.582 --> 00:38:00.326
What does that mean?

00:38:00.426 --> 00:38:00.647
Non-movie.

00:38:01.027 --> 00:38:02.411
We are going to estimate.

00:38:02.651 --> 00:38:03.273
Is it going to be perfect?

00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:05.217
Heck no.

00:38:05.237 --> 00:38:08.244
We're going to do random, systematic, or transect.

00:38:08.264 --> 00:38:09.347
What do y'all think if we're using hula hoop?

00:38:21.967 --> 00:38:24.409
and see where it lands.

00:38:24.429 --> 00:38:27.853
So when I first started doing this, it was in January.

00:38:27.993 --> 00:38:33.158
We were outside, and we were just assessing the biodiversity of what's in the grass, really.

00:38:33.178 --> 00:38:44.649
And now we have a native garden, so we can use it a little bit more for that and stuff.

00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:47.031
So yeah.

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:48.733
So you need your journal.

00:39:02.028 --> 00:39:15.009
I think what we're going to do now is I left the hula hoops outside.

00:39:15.049 --> 00:39:18.054
We're not using quadrants.

00:39:18.254 --> 00:39:21.940
Grab a partner, grab a hula hoop, and I'll give you further instructions.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.207
We're going to kind of go wear moth and batlets.

00:39:26.287 --> 00:39:28.530
And bear poop.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:29.672
Close your eyes.
