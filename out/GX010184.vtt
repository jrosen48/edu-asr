WEBVTT

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:44.453
[SPEAKER_09] So Josh, is the goal to have a place-based curriculum ready for 2033?

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:48.843
[SPEAKER_09] That's our next adoption.

00:00:49.643 --> 00:00:53.713
[SPEAKER_07] 2033, so it's eight years.

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:19.846
[SPEAKER_09] But in eight years, I think you could do a curriculum.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.769
[SPEAKER_09] Like, I think it would be good to sell one to all of Tennessee.

00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:35.471
[SPEAKER_09] Well, and if you could integrate them with chemistry and biology, they're all going to be readopted in 2033.

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:41.301
[SPEAKER_09] And I think place-based education is good for the kids.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:45.215
[SPEAKER_09] But we're going towards these storyline-based things.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:52.423
[SPEAKER_09] The problems that we have is they don't have a lot of labs in them, the one that we purchased, which is making the kids actually get out and do less.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.230
[SPEAKER_09] But they're doing less.

00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:02.254
[SPEAKER_09] It's all paperwork.

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.296
[SPEAKER_09] And that's not good for kids.

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.903
[SPEAKER_09] I got it.

00:04:36.923 --> 00:04:38.536
[SPEAKER_09] I just had the wrong thing selected.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.632
[SPEAKER_09] Like I know I knew how to do this.

00:06:13.762 --> 00:06:16.514
[SPEAKER_09] Okay.

00:07:14.612 --> 00:07:17.437
[SPEAKER_09] collaboration in co-design?

00:07:18.838 --> 00:07:30.233
[SPEAKER_12] Can you just swap them?

00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:37.603
[SPEAKER_09] No, no, no, we're not staying in the friendship circle.

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:40.567
[SPEAKER_10] Yes.

00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:43.911
[SPEAKER_09] Yeah, we're going into a river.

00:07:44.093 --> 00:07:47.317
[SPEAKER_09] Which, but I mean.

00:07:47.357 --> 00:07:51.120
[SPEAKER_04] Leave the poncho behind and just commit to it.

00:07:51.242 --> 00:07:53.704
[SPEAKER_04] And just go swimming.

00:07:55.607 --> 00:08:07.581
[SPEAKER_07] Multiple times this week I've gotten that little pew pew.

00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:09.983
[SPEAKER_00] We're high enough in the mountains, we're not.

00:08:10.004 --> 00:08:10.944
[SPEAKER_00] We're uphill.

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:06.851
[SPEAKER_09] So those lab safety things were driving me nuts.

00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:09.416
[SPEAKER_09] The day I was doing it, it kept on click.

00:09:09.475 --> 00:09:19.091
[SPEAKER_09] I'm like, I got to the point where I took a picture of the answer that I put and then pushed submit because I couldn't get one to stay.

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:25.341
[SPEAKER_09] And I submitted my answer and them telling me that it was the right answer because I could only get a 90 on that one.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.663
[SPEAKER_09] I think it's like number three.

00:09:31.081 --> 00:09:51.097
[SPEAKER_06] However many times you have to take it to get 100 but made me look like an idiot that I took it four times to try to get this 100 when I was getting it right every time.

00:10:23.932 --> 00:10:39.140
[SPEAKER_12] I had them make the graph that the data table together and then I put it in

00:11:14.861 --> 00:11:15.363
[SPEAKER_00] Okay, that's cool.

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:17.265
[SPEAKER_12] That's cool, art and data, okay, that's cool.

00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:27.724
[SPEAKER_12] How many of you, I know some of you used it last year, how many of you used Code App at all with the students before?

00:11:27.744 --> 00:11:30.629
[SPEAKER_12] This last year, Jen last year, cool.

00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:34.034
[SPEAKER_12] Any other tools that you've used around,

00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:50.421
[SPEAKER_06] Yeah, it's easy for them to get lost.

00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:39.105
[SPEAKER_10] know what we get.

00:13:18.184 --> 00:13:19.269
[SPEAKER_12] I'm super energetic.

00:14:08.842 --> 00:14:12.889
[SPEAKER_09] Allison was asking about Excel, but kids don't have it.

00:14:12.908 --> 00:14:13.250
[SPEAKER_12] Right.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:17.355
[SPEAKER_12] And very similar to Google Sheets.

00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:17.897
[SPEAKER_12] Pretty much.

00:14:19.118 --> 00:14:20.780
[SPEAKER_10] Google's getting there.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.923
[SPEAKER_10] Google's trying to get there.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:24.505
[SPEAKER_10] It's the shortcuts that's different, really.

00:14:24.525 --> 00:14:25.467
[SPEAKER_10] Shortcuts.

00:14:25.847 --> 00:14:30.655
[SPEAKER_10] But you can input your own shortcuts into Google Sheets, though.

00:14:31.557 --> 00:14:34.782
[SPEAKER_10] So it's pretty useful.

00:14:34.802 --> 00:14:34.902
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:55.057
[SPEAKER_12] So how about this, if you wanna go.

00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:35.288
[SPEAKER_09] It's all going in there all that just makes my soul happy

00:16:37.477 --> 00:16:38.198
[SPEAKER_09] I love that.

00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:38.940
[SPEAKER_09] Right?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.783
[SPEAKER_09] And then so they could all see it.

00:16:40.802 --> 00:16:46.751
[SPEAKER_09] Like, if your grade band was all studying, like, you want our butterflies, everybody goes out on this day.

00:16:46.792 --> 00:16:49.475
[SPEAKER_09] That's crazy, Mom.

00:16:49.596 --> 00:16:50.538
[SPEAKER_09] Yeah.

00:16:50.557 --> 00:16:57.889
[SPEAKER_09] But if you had a curriculum that we all shared that Tennessee adopted that was play-spaced and data-driven.

00:16:58.889 --> 00:17:02.075
[SPEAKER_09] They should be able to fit it in there if they wanted to.

00:17:02.416 --> 00:17:02.796
[SPEAKER_09] Right?

00:17:04.318 --> 00:17:05.599
[SPEAKER_09] Like, think about storylines.

00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.282
[SPEAKER_09] Everybody's doing it.

00:17:09.659 --> 00:17:12.461
[SPEAKER_09] We could make this more interactive.

00:17:12.481 --> 00:17:14.624
[SPEAKER_06] And it doesn't matter if you're inner city.

00:17:15.285 --> 00:17:19.910
[SPEAKER_09] You're representing the city demographic.

00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:25.295
[SPEAKER_09] And you can, whatever bugs, you identify everything that you see that day at your school.

00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:26.896
[SPEAKER_09] And so does every other school.

00:17:27.217 --> 00:17:29.118
[SPEAKER_09] And then the next day, everybody goes back.

00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:37.928
[SPEAKER_09] And you could see the difference between Farragut and West, or Farragut and Nashville,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:52.061
[SPEAKER_09] He said that wasn't part of his plan.

00:17:52.564 --> 00:17:53.665
[SPEAKER_09] Just giving resources.

00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:58.616
[SPEAKER_03] Want to write a curriculum?

00:18:02.343 --> 00:18:10.231
[SPEAKER_09] But a series of Tennessee wants to adopt something that a new teacher can just pick up.

00:18:11.032 --> 00:18:16.279
[SPEAKER_03] Which is scripted and it's killing me.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.141
[SPEAKER_09] Poor Allison.

00:18:17.361 --> 00:18:19.703
[SPEAKER_09] She came to the opening training with me.

00:18:19.723 --> 00:18:21.986
[SPEAKER_09] And she's like, doesn't that take all the art out of teaching?

00:18:22.046 --> 00:18:24.789
[SPEAKER_09] And I'm like, I feel so good.

00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:30.155
[SPEAKER_10] I graduated from UT in December of 2022.

00:18:30.135 --> 00:18:35.035
[SPEAKER_05] So I came in right whenever they were wrapping up the standards that we were on board.

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:38.086
[SPEAKER_10] And I was like, oh, so this is what it's like to be a teacher.

00:18:40.378 --> 00:18:42.561
[SPEAKER_09] Well, I moved here two years ago.

00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:43.863
[SPEAKER_09] They gave us pre-AP.

00:18:44.825 --> 00:18:47.127
[SPEAKER_09] And so I was the first one to teach it.

00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:49.590
[SPEAKER_09] I went through it all.

00:18:49.611 --> 00:18:52.535
[SPEAKER_09] I added things in for the implementation, lined up all the notes.

00:18:52.994 --> 00:18:55.317
[SPEAKER_09] And then they go and change editions.

00:18:55.337 --> 00:18:56.920
[SPEAKER_09] And this one's so scripted.

00:18:57.079 --> 00:19:00.545
[SPEAKER_09] And the stuff we learn here is so cool.

00:19:00.704 --> 00:19:04.509
[SPEAKER_09] And to not be able to implement any of it hurts.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.251
[SPEAKER_09] So I'm in mornings.

00:19:12.221 --> 00:19:25.215
[SPEAKER_09] But I think this group could write a group.

00:19:25.316 --> 00:19:30.001
[SPEAKER_09] And write one that went from middle school through high school.

00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:35.007
[SPEAKER_09] So what you do builds on what we do.

00:19:40.201 --> 00:19:42.103
[SPEAKER_09] Like they're doing all this research.

00:19:42.143 --> 00:19:44.205
[SPEAKER_09] I feel like it should go into curriculum planning.

00:19:57.201 --> 00:20:03.008
[SPEAKER_09] And I agree that it should just be lessons to implement that all go together.

00:20:03.028 --> 00:20:09.516
[SPEAKER_09] I mean, I like the idea of a phenomenon that leads all the instruction and the kids finding out things and problem-based learning.

00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:16.772
[SPEAKER_09] to like the science of the moment, like what the kids asked.

00:20:16.913 --> 00:20:20.477
[SPEAKER_09] Like there's no leeway in what we've got right now.

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:28.346
[SPEAKER_09] And I swear if they'd chosen to stickleback fish, like my kids would want to like jump off the bridge.

00:20:28.366 --> 00:20:32.511
[SPEAKER_01] Because six weeks talking about a stickleback fish, we can't leave.

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:40.261
[SPEAKER_10] I have like 15 lessons worth, and there's sometimes more than one day for each lesson about bath bombs.

00:20:44.865 --> 00:21:02.992
[SPEAKER_09] Getting them through the full period.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.798
[SPEAKER_10] there goes a little too much into it.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.028
[SPEAKER_10] A lot of these kids already know what an atom is, or they know what molecules are.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:31.140
[SPEAKER_10] Whenever we're talking about platforms, we have to sit there and not say the word atom or molecule.

00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:57.971
[SPEAKER_09] It's word we earn.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:08.800
[SPEAKER_00] Kitem.

00:22:10.082 --> 00:22:19.316
[SPEAKER_10] Kitem has organized all of our content into one platform, but it's all of the sci-ed stuff, like storylines and everything.

00:22:22.641 --> 00:22:27.788
[SPEAKER_10] But they've just organized it into Kitem, and we're supposed to be getting these workbooks for them to work out of.

00:22:27.807 --> 00:22:32.515
[SPEAKER_03] And I...

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:41.339
[SPEAKER_10] that they were going to be giving us them.

00:22:44.083 --> 00:22:51.130
[SPEAKER_10] My thing is I would like to see it now and they haven't given us a copy of what the students will look like.

00:22:52.191 --> 00:22:58.978
[SPEAKER_10] All I have is two teachers editions for the first unit and the second unit.

00:22:58.998 --> 00:23:03.041
[SPEAKER_10] They haven't given us anything else.

00:23:13.416 --> 00:23:15.563
[SPEAKER_01] think it's just

00:23:49.546 --> 00:23:52.185
[SPEAKER_10] They really enjoy seventh grade science.

00:23:52.207 --> 00:23:55.269
[SPEAKER_10] That's where you see a lot of their growth.

00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:11.798
[SPEAKER_10] Wednesday the other two science teachers from my grade at my school are meeting

00:26:24.728 --> 00:26:27.432
[SPEAKER_08] He's the one that keeps sneaking in little projects.

00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:28.553
[SPEAKER_08] I'm like, stop it, man.

00:26:28.593 --> 00:26:30.315
[SPEAKER_08] He's just a little scattered, I think.

00:26:30.675 --> 00:26:31.096
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah.

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:33.118
[SPEAKER_04] He's got a seven-year-old kid.

00:26:34.681 --> 00:26:35.301
[SPEAKER_08] I mean, I get it.

00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:36.462
[SPEAKER_08] I met him during.

00:26:36.564 --> 00:26:38.105
[SPEAKER_08] I was still like, seriously?

00:26:38.125 --> 00:26:38.465
[SPEAKER_08] Come on.

00:26:38.486 --> 00:26:41.170
[SPEAKER_08] Just open them all up at the beginning of the semester.

00:26:41.289 --> 00:26:45.816
[SPEAKER_08] And the other teacher I have, I opened them all up, but she has a really strict policy.

00:26:46.016 --> 00:26:46.737
[SPEAKER_08] You can turn it.

00:26:52.166 --> 00:27:00.884
[SPEAKER_08] Do them all ahead of time, just don't submit them.

00:27:01.464 --> 00:27:09.821
[SPEAKER_09] You would also probably enjoy their fishy climate training.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:29:08.232
[SPEAKER_09] Drag it over to Nick's new because it's gigantic and I don't

00:29:30.758 --> 00:29:36.078
[SPEAKER_09] He's just gonna accumulate stuff.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.451
[SPEAKER_05] So yeah, take the time, drag everything you don't use.

00:31:24.377 --> 00:31:33.567
[SPEAKER_02] I don't really have an idea who this is, but what I love, and I say this to my staff, is the norms are great, and almost everybody can come up with a good set of norms.

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:44.400
[SPEAKER_02] The living within those norms is tricky, because oftentimes, and one of our usual norms is, take ownership over the impacts that you have.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.625
[SPEAKER_02] And usually everyone's like, of course I do that, but you don't always know the impacts that you have.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:56.970
[SPEAKER_02] And sometimes you can hurt somebody's feelings, never know that you did, because you certainly didn't intend to.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:02.218
[SPEAKER_02] But something you said or a way that you said it caught somebody wrong.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.044
[SPEAKER_02] And in those moments, you'd never know.

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:12.113
[SPEAKER_02] Like the person would be hurt, the person who did it would never know, and we'd all go on, and the system remains the same.

00:32:13.035 --> 00:32:18.583
[SPEAKER_02] But in our situation, and what I like about our staff and what I like about this group already is,

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:30.968
[SPEAKER_02] sharing that sense that I got my feelings stepped on, or this happened and I just wanted to bring it up.

00:32:30.988 --> 00:32:32.269
[SPEAKER_02] So it came to me.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:36.356
[SPEAKER_02] And so I just want us to know, this stuff is happening.

00:32:36.897 --> 00:32:39.182
[SPEAKER_02] And we don't mean it, and we don't intend it, typically.

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:41.465
[SPEAKER_02] So.

00:32:53.545 --> 00:33:05.090
[SPEAKER_02] Really focus on how we respond to things how we talk about things language that we use and

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:15.189
[SPEAKER_02] Don't sit there.

00:33:15.249 --> 00:33:16.010
[SPEAKER_02] Don't suffer.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:21.203
[SPEAKER_02] Don't think, oh, it's just because of this or that, or they didn't mean it, so I'm just not going to say anything.

00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:22.787
[SPEAKER_02] If you had that moment, just say it.

00:33:22.807 --> 00:33:26.296
[SPEAKER_02] I mean, this is probably the most friendly group of people you're going to work with.

00:33:26.476 --> 00:33:29.001
[SPEAKER_02] I mean, these are people that really want to do the best by everybody.

00:33:29.784 --> 00:33:30.546
[SPEAKER_02] So this is how we learn.

00:33:31.106 --> 00:33:32.309
[SPEAKER_02] And this is what happens in classrooms.

00:33:44.305 --> 00:33:49.577
[SPEAKER_02] We're going to be working together all afternoon, all evening, tomorrow, and then hopefully later on after we leave here.

00:33:49.597 --> 00:33:52.304
[SPEAKER_02] And I want everybody to feel good about ourselves.

00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:55.211
[SPEAKER_02] This is not like, this is not John's calling somebody else.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.682
[SPEAKER_02] He's just recognizing that somewhere along the line, we didn't quite live up to our boundaries.

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:15.447
[SPEAKER_02] But maybe, I mean, we may spend a little more time even in the next couple of days just unpacking, like what does this look like?

00:34:15.467 --> 00:34:17.110
[SPEAKER_02] What does this look like when it doesn't happen?

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:21.775
[SPEAKER_02] Have you ever had it happen that you got something hurt and the person didn't know?

00:34:21.795 --> 00:34:23.717
[SPEAKER_02] They didn't know?

00:34:25.561 --> 00:34:26.983
[SPEAKER_02] Were you able to bring it up?

00:34:27.003 --> 00:34:29.266
[SPEAKER_02] Was there enough safety there to bring something?

00:34:29.286 --> 00:34:30.568
[SPEAKER_02] Like that's tricky.

00:34:30.588 --> 00:34:33.972
[SPEAKER_02] I'm just glad to know that this is that kind of place.

00:34:33.992 --> 00:34:35.934
[SPEAKER_02] So these are sitting over there.

00:34:36.375 --> 00:34:37.617
[SPEAKER_02] We wrote them down.

00:35:11.887 --> 00:35:35.346
[SPEAKER_02] What time do you think that will end up being?

00:35:59.659 --> 00:36:02.514
[SPEAKER_02] We'll take another look at the weather then.
