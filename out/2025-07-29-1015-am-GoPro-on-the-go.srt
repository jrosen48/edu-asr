1
00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:03,160
What did we call these little guys?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,562
They're like if you're out.

3
00:00:09,049 --> 00:00:11,593
No, this says no.

4
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:12,335
This says 100%.

5
00:00:12,495 --> 00:00:14,799
I don't know about that.

6
00:00:14,819 --> 00:00:16,361
That wasn't what we identified.

7
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:18,084
This keeps changing.

8
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:18,525
White Avons.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,231
What do you use?

10
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,413
White Avons.

11
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:24,535
This is the iNaturalist.

12
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:25,937
Oh.

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,701
Oh, that's better.

14
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:34,009
Where it says White Avons, it's actually Pennywort, Marsh Pennywort, which makes more sense.

15
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:34,950
So change it.

16
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:36,752
So White Avons?

17
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,136
Yeah.

18
00:00:40,156 --> 00:00:41,518
Pennywort.

19
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:42,799
So it's not this.

20
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:48,646
So it's F of F. So anywhere these little guys are F of F. They're kind of throughout.

21
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:56,616
There's little and Pennywort spreads.

22
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,649
It's like vines.

23
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:15,948
Other things you want to write?

24
00:01:19,032 --> 00:01:24,258
What other things from our list do you feel are jumping out at you as important in this area?

25
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:28,122
So we got white clover.

26
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:44,795
You mentioned the ariotic or ariotic dazed flower, but I'm not familiar with it.

27
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,178
I don't know either.

28
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,964
It could have been a wrong identification because of only a partial plant.

29
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:49,726
Okay.

30
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:50,587
We can just ignore it.

31
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:51,129
I don't know.

32
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:51,710
Okay.

33
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,173
I think we're good.

34
00:01:53,293 --> 00:01:54,476
Yeah.

35
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:55,358
Everyone's wrapping up.

36
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:22,285
Let's go upstairs.

37
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:26,168
Wrap it up.

38
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:38,760
Give them a five.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,744
All right, y'all, if we could circle up real quick.

40
00:02:44,806 --> 00:02:52,654
Our teacher leaders are discussing a slight adjustment to this schedule, but I wanted to ask you all, just really quick, think to yourself either a yes or no and why.

41
00:02:53,916 --> 00:03:03,786
Is what we created here together either yes, a data visualization, or no, think to yourself and then why?

42
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,444
Like this specifically?

43
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:12,209
Is this a data visualization here?

44
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,329
Yeah.

45
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:13,851
Turn and talk to the person next to you.

46
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:14,152
Why?

47
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,954
Yes, no, why?

48
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:26,950
I say yes because you got different visual representations but also different descriptions that cover even the flowering stages that are not pictured right now.

49
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,313
A lot of it's qualitative.

50
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:32,999
Raise your hand if you said yes.

51
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,060
It is.

52
00:03:35,356 --> 00:03:37,019
Raise your hand if you said no, it is not.

53
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:39,444
We're kind of liking it.

54
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:40,145
Hey, great.

55
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:40,546
Love it.

56
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:46,398
Why is it if you said yes?

57
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:48,001
Qualitative data.

58
00:03:48,021 --> 00:03:50,045
Qualitative data.

59
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:51,548
We've got to take quantitative data.

60
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:54,113
Is this qualitative or quantitative data?

61
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:55,255
Qualitative.

62
00:03:55,555 --> 00:04:01,401
We didn't have any measurements.

63
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:06,306
So it could be a bit of quantitative data?

64
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,110
This is mixed methods.

65
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:12,352
What about no?

66
00:04:12,412 --> 00:04:13,413
Why do you say it's not?

67
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:21,322
Well, mostly because it's not accurate representation of what we're finding out in the film.

68
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,643
It's not the same amount.

69
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:26,011
Is a bar graph accurate information?

70
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:28,453
It can be.

71
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:34,778
But the information that you're talking about is that quality, that includes the way of data collection, right?

72
00:04:34,999 --> 00:04:40,143
So like accurate representation may also involve like how you collect data.

73
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:52,174
If we count how many types each plot has, then the data would change and data visualization will also change.

74
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:53,694
So what are the limitations?

75
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:59,359
The limitations, is that like the way of data collection?

76
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:05,565
I know visually that some kids would not really see this as something that would be eye-catching.

77
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:13,152
Like data visual, they would just kind of see this as something uninteresting.

78
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:20,239
That's why I don't think it's very data visual, like just because... The aesthetics are important to data vis for sure, absolutely.

79
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,020
What were you saying?

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,161
This is...

81
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:32,651
It's data about each individual to help you identify it in situ so that we can get our accurate counts.

82
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:41,528
It's data about each of the, they're not actually necessarily species but maybe groups, types that we're looking at.

83
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:45,516
We tried for species but I'm sure we got a couple down there.

84
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:49,257
It is data visualization.

85
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:58,547
We're presenting a case for the data that defines each of our groups, whether they're species or genus or whatever.

86
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:03,112
And it's what was most commonly found amongst all of us, right?

87
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,775
The things that we had the most when we all came back.

88
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:08,078
So even though it's not necessarily

89
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:35,196
representative of oh we saw 50% this 80% not 80% right a is not the most common b second c third right but it is that these are the most common things that we as a group found in the hole in right and then everything else is out does it tell us information we can't find in a book yes and about a specific place did we use a computer no a technology no

90
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:38,018
These are just things to point out to students.

91
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:41,307
Data visualization can mean a lot of different things and can tell us information.

92
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:45,359
So I just wanted to call this out because I thought it was a beautiful little thing for you.

93
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,270
I think the cool thing that I think about this is it makes science less scary.

94
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:54,246
For a lot of kids, because a lot of kids don't think in numbers.

95
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:07,549
A lot of kids just see what they see outside and they're like well I'm not a scientist because I'm just grouping things together and you know when you're seven you make potions with your grass and I got this kind and this kind and this makes this potion right?

96
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,055
So I'm thinking in my like 10 year old brain of my daughter

97
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:12,730
That's science to her.

98
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:18,666
Especially to be able to have that word data without it being this like, oh my gosh, that's math.

99
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,253
I have no idea what that means.

100
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:23,098
That's a whole different kind of math.

101
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:25,585
This is still science and data.

102
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,364
Nice to be tightened up.

103
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:39,559
Yeah and I think that was like talking about those different levels too of different grades is you can do this and then they can make their presentations and be done with it or you can take to the next level that we'll be trying to do later on this afternoon.

104
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:46,888
So we did we did some subscripts on f because we didn't have a lot of a through e so we have f of whatever because we had lettered ours to begin with.

105
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,071
Nice that's good okay.

106
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:49,952
Pass it over to Jen.

107
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:53,225
Okay, so I think we need a break.

108
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:54,827
Does coming to break sound good?

109
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:55,048
Yep.

110
00:07:55,468 --> 00:08:00,636
Yeah, so we're going to be outside again except this time we're going to collect some water quality data.

111
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:04,201
Meet over here in about 10 minutes.

112
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:11,432
You're going to need your journal, clipboard, pencil, and I would definitely recommend a mat to sit on and I have them over there.

113
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:14,016
Where do you want to put our

114
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:16,142
Bring them over.

115
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,047
Bring the hoops over.

116
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,892
You want them on the rock where the rest are?

117
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:27,913
Yeah, on the rock.

118
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:28,495
Ten minutes in the pavilion.
