SPEAKER_09:
So Josh, is the goal to have a place-based curriculum ready for 2033? That's our next adoption. 
SPEAKER_07:
2033, so it's eight years. 
SPEAKER_09:
But in eight years, I think you could do a curriculum. Like, I think it would be good to sell one to all of Tennessee. Well, and if you could integrate them with chemistry and biology, they're all going to be readopted in 2033. And I think place-based education is good for the kids. But we're going towards these storyline-based things. The problems that we have is they don't have a lot of labs in them, the one that we purchased, which is making the kids actually get out and do less. But they're doing less. It's all paperwork. And that's not good for kids. I got it. I just had the wrong thing selected. Like I know I knew how to do this. Okay. collaboration in co-design? 
SPEAKER_12:
Can you just swap them? 
SPEAKER_09:
No, no, no, we're not staying in the friendship circle. 
SPEAKER_10:
Yes. 
SPEAKER_09:
Yeah, we're going into a river. Which, but I mean. 
SPEAKER_04:
Leave the poncho behind and just commit to it. And just go swimming. 
SPEAKER_07:
Multiple times this week I've gotten that little pew pew. 
SPEAKER_00:
We're high enough in the mountains, we're not. We're uphill. 
SPEAKER_09:
So those lab safety things were driving me nuts. The day I was doing it, it kept on click. I'm like, I got to the point where I took a picture of the answer that I put and then pushed submit because I couldn't get one to stay. And I submitted my answer and them telling me that it was the right answer because I could only get a 90 on that one. I think it's like number three. 
SPEAKER_06:
However many times you have to take it to get 100 but made me look like an idiot that I took it four times to try to get this 100 when I was getting it right every time. 
SPEAKER_12:
I had them make the graph that the data table together and then I put it in 
SPEAKER_00:
Okay, that's cool. 
SPEAKER_12:
That's cool, art and data, okay, that's cool. How many of you, I know some of you used it last year, how many of you used Code App at all with the students before? This last year, Jen last year, cool. Any other tools that you've used around, 
SPEAKER_06:
Yeah, it's easy for them to get lost. 
SPEAKER_10:
know what we get. 
SPEAKER_12:
I'm super energetic. 
SPEAKER_09:
Allison was asking about Excel, but kids don't have it. 
SPEAKER_12:
Right. And very similar to Google Sheets. Pretty much. 
SPEAKER_10:
Google's getting there. Google's trying to get there. It's the shortcuts that's different, really. Shortcuts. But you can input your own shortcuts into Google Sheets, though. So it's pretty useful. 
SPEAKER_12:
Yeah. So how about this, if you wanna go. 
SPEAKER_09:
It's all going in there all that just makes my soul happy I love that. Right? And then so they could all see it. Like, if your grade band was all studying, like, you want our butterflies, everybody goes out on this day. That's crazy, Mom. Yeah. But if you had a curriculum that we all shared that Tennessee adopted that was play-spaced and data-driven. They should be able to fit it in there if they wanted to. Right? Like, think about storylines. Everybody's doing it. We could make this more interactive. 
SPEAKER_06:
And it doesn't matter if you're inner city. 
SPEAKER_09:
You're representing the city demographic. And you can, whatever bugs, you identify everything that you see that day at your school. And so does every other school. And then the next day, everybody goes back. And you could see the difference between Farragut and West, or Farragut and Nashville, He said that wasn't part of his plan. Just giving resources. 
SPEAKER_03:
Want to write a curriculum? 
SPEAKER_09:
But a series of Tennessee wants to adopt something that a new teacher can just pick up. 
SPEAKER_03:
Which is scripted and it's killing me. 
SPEAKER_09:
Poor Allison. She came to the opening training with me. And she's like, doesn't that take all the art out of teaching? And I'm like, I feel so good. 
SPEAKER_10:
I graduated from UT in December of 2022. 
SPEAKER_05:
So I came in right whenever they were wrapping up the standards that we were on board. 
SPEAKER_10:
And I was like, oh, so this is what it's like to be a teacher. 
SPEAKER_09:
Well, I moved here two years ago. They gave us pre-AP. And so I was the first one to teach it. I went through it all. I added things in for the implementation, lined up all the notes. And then they go and change editions. And this one's so scripted. And the stuff we learn here is so cool. And to not be able to implement any of it hurts. So I'm in mornings. But I think this group could write a group. And write one that went from middle school through high school. So what you do builds on what we do. Like they're doing all this research. I feel like it should go into curriculum planning. And I agree that it should just be lessons to implement that all go together. I mean, I like the idea of a phenomenon that leads all the instruction and the kids finding out things and problem-based learning. to like the science of the moment, like what the kids asked. Like there's no leeway in what we've got right now. And I swear if they'd chosen to stickleback fish, like my kids would want to like jump off the bridge. 
SPEAKER_01:
Because six weeks talking about a stickleback fish, we can't leave. 
SPEAKER_10:
I have like 15 lessons worth, and there's sometimes more than one day for each lesson about bath bombs. 
SPEAKER_09:
Getting them through the full period. 
SPEAKER_10:
there goes a little too much into it. A lot of these kids already know what an atom is, or they know what molecules are. Whenever we're talking about platforms, we have to sit there and not say the word atom or molecule. 
SPEAKER_09:
It's word we earn. 
SPEAKER_00:
Kitem. 
SPEAKER_10:
Kitem has organized all of our content into one platform, but it's all of the sci-ed stuff, like storylines and everything. But they've just organized it into Kitem, and we're supposed to be getting these workbooks for them to work out of. 
SPEAKER_03:
And I... 
SPEAKER_10:
that they were going to be giving us them. My thing is I would like to see it now and they haven't given us a copy of what the students will look like. All I have is two teachers editions for the first unit and the second unit. They haven't given us anything else. 
SPEAKER_01:
think it's just 
SPEAKER_10:
They really enjoy seventh grade science. That's where you see a lot of their growth. Wednesday the other two science teachers from my grade at my school are meeting 
SPEAKER_08:
He's the one that keeps sneaking in little projects. I'm like, stop it, man. He's just a little scattered, I think. Yeah. 
SPEAKER_04:
He's got a seven-year-old kid. 
SPEAKER_08:
I mean, I get it. I met him during. I was still like, seriously? Come on. Just open them all up at the beginning of the semester. And the other teacher I have, I opened them all up, but she has a really strict policy. You can turn it. Do them all ahead of time, just don't submit them. 
SPEAKER_09:
You would also probably enjoy their fishy climate training. Drag it over to Nick's new because it's gigantic and I don't He's just gonna accumulate stuff. 
SPEAKER_05:
So yeah, take the time, drag everything you don't use. 
SPEAKER_02:
I don't really have an idea who this is, but what I love, and I say this to my staff, is the norms are great, and almost everybody can come up with a good set of norms. The living within those norms is tricky, because oftentimes, and one of our usual norms is, take ownership over the impacts that you have. And usually everyone's like, of course I do that, but you don't always know the impacts that you have. And sometimes you can hurt somebody's feelings, never know that you did, because you certainly didn't intend to. But something you said or a way that you said it caught somebody wrong. And in those moments, you'd never know. Like the person would be hurt, the person who did it would never know, and we'd all go on, and the system remains the same. But in our situation, and what I like about our staff and what I like about this group already is, sharing that sense that I got my feelings stepped on, or this happened and I just wanted to bring it up. So it came to me. And so I just want us to know, this stuff is happening. And we don't mean it, and we don't intend it, typically. So. Really focus on how we respond to things how we talk about things language that we use and Don't sit there. Don't suffer. Don't think, oh, it's just because of this or that, or they didn't mean it, so I'm just not going to say anything. If you had that moment, just say it. I mean, this is probably the most friendly group of people you're going to work with. I mean, these are people that really want to do the best by everybody. So this is how we learn. And this is what happens in classrooms. We're going to be working together all afternoon, all evening, tomorrow, and then hopefully later on after we leave here. And I want everybody to feel good about ourselves. This is not like, this is not John's calling somebody else. He's just recognizing that somewhere along the line, we didn't quite live up to our boundaries. But maybe, I mean, we may spend a little more time even in the next couple of days just unpacking, like what does this look like? What does this look like when it doesn't happen? Have you ever had it happen that you got something hurt and the person didn't know? They didn't know? Were you able to bring it up? Was there enough safety there to bring something? Like that's tricky. I'm just glad to know that this is that kind of place. So these are sitting over there. We wrote them down. What time do you think that will end up being? We'll take another look at the weather then.
