00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:06.287
You can use the footage to make like a... Oh, does it need one of these?

00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:07.729
I think you got one on there.

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:08.210
Okay.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.831
Oh, okay.

00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:09.191
I see it.

00:00:09.231 --> 00:00:09.512
Sorry.

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:14.478
This is very... I think David and Tom were wearing them yesterday.

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:19.005
I'm gonna do this real quick.

00:00:19.045 --> 00:00:23.811
A little... Surprisingly helpful for trying to keep track of when the heck stuff is.

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:24.072
Alright.

00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:25.233
Does it timestamp anything?

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:26.595
Yeah.

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.003
It's probably in the metadata.

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:37.394
Yeah, no problem.

00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:41.359
Vincent, have you got a partner?

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.300
I do.

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:43.081
All right.

00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:44.223
Somebody stole me.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:44.864
That's all right.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:45.545
Let's see.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.532
Do you have a partner?

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:52.653
Probably not.

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:53.755
Can I work with you, Megan?

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:55.197
Yes, I would love that.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:56.278
Fantastic.

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:58.173
Have you got a partner?

00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:58.533
Alright.

00:00:58.553 --> 00:01:02.257
Are you trying to trade me already?

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:09.966
I was trying to include people that might not have a partner.

00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:11.067
Good, how are you?

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:11.607
Everything good?

00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:12.268
It's great.

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:12.949
Did it go over your last line?

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:13.109
It did.

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.349
It did.

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:13.830
I slipped.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.831
I didn't get attacked.

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:18.335
Nope, I grabbed a pencil.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.180
How'd you sleep last night?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.380
Aw, hell.

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:26.701
Your alarm woke me up, thank God, because I was dead.

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:27.081
Really?

00:01:27.101 --> 00:01:28.022
Yeah.

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:29.103
At 7.40.

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:29.543
OK.

00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:31.485
And I was like, Megan, we have to get out.

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:32.826
I didn't think it was that loud.

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:34.108
No, I needed it.

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:37.030
And it's also my ringer on my phone.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.292
So I was tuned in because of the sounds, right?

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:40.754
So I was like, oh, yeah.

00:01:40.774 --> 00:01:41.655
I was like, my phone.

00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:49.882
Y'all can go down towards where Frances is.

00:01:50.063 --> 00:01:51.784
I would have been linked to everything.

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:52.725
I meant to send this to her.

00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:58.288
We did something like this in my high school class and I thought I would be clever.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.414
And I picked someone with a really, really big tree as my one meter square.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:10.963
But the problem was the teacher and my dad had been friends for 20 some years and he knew that I was trying to be clever.

00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:14.367
He says, you got to count all the species up there.

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:17.191
Hey, let's count off.

00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:19.033
One, two, three.

00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:22.290
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.075
12.

00:02:27.596 --> 00:02:30.919
Tell the bears we're here.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.780
We're missing 13?

00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:32.601
Yes.

00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:33.142
You're 12?

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:33.963
Yes.

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:34.083
13.

00:02:34.103 --> 00:02:34.443
14.

00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:37.847
What's the point of the numbers?

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:38.708
Well, someone's missing.

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:39.709
15.

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.072
But who's missing?

00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:42.552
16.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.174
She hasn't had any.

00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:45.295
She's laying down.

00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:46.016
Where's 17 at?

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:46.216
I'm 17.

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:46.857
Hey, oh, OK.

00:02:46.877 --> 00:02:47.418
We're all here.

00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:49.560
So this is what we're going to do.

00:02:49.996 --> 00:02:54.403
You know, depending on what grade level, you might want to amp this up a little bit, right?

00:02:54.443 --> 00:03:01.393
You might actually want to categorize by species name and use iNaturalist or use a key, whatever feels comfortable to you.

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:05.038
But what we're going to do today is we're going to identify species by just a letter.

00:03:05.058 --> 00:03:11.888
So don't be confused between these species letters and the letters of like the ABCs that Josh was referring to earlier.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.916
So what we're going to do first is we're going to run a preliminary trial.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:19.800
What we're going to do in our groups, we're going to grab a hula hoop

00:03:20.827 --> 00:03:23.590
And you're just gonna toss this and do a little random sampling.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.412
And you're gonna come over here with your partner.

00:03:26.452 --> 00:03:27.773
One partner's gonna time you.

00:03:28.594 --> 00:03:31.217
Okay, the other person's gonna look, or maybe together, right?

00:03:31.757 --> 00:03:37.222
You're gonna look and try to identify all the different things you see in this little hula hoop, okay?

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:45.170
And what I'd like you to do is actually pick out one sample of each as a representative for each of the individual species you see.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.711
Does that make sense?

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:46.991
Right?

00:03:47.592 --> 00:03:48.673
And then we'll

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:51.827
The first time, we're going to have eight minutes to do this.

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:54.771
So when eight minutes expires, we're done looking at this.

00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:57.714
Then what you'll do is you'll move on to stage two.

00:03:58.335 --> 00:04:00.858
And I'm going to give you further instruction at that point.

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:01.319
Is that cool?

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.569
So after you're done identifying what looks different from one another, then you're just going to pause and hang until I give you further instruction.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.671
All right.

00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:12.412
And pick your samples.

00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:18.019
Find a spot, toss that hula hoop, and then set that timer to eight minutes.

00:04:18.202 --> 00:04:26.232
Well, let's not do the gravel.

00:04:27.394 --> 00:04:31.919
I learned my lesson on that.

00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:34.623
Sure.

00:04:36.305 --> 00:04:36.846
All right.

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:45.677
So.

00:04:48.458 --> 00:05:17.284
one and go for it get it got this grass that's another i think that's the same i think that's just a flower is this a different species of grass this looks different it's much thinner yeah i think so

00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:28.653
Okay, that's... So lots of clover, lots of plantain, lots of grass.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.843
We've got some moss here.

00:05:37.615 --> 00:06:02.020
The way I've done it in the past is just like we're gathering today.

00:06:02.236 --> 00:06:05.480
Oh, that is some kind of goo.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.244
Is that a decomposing leaf?

00:06:09.264 --> 00:06:09.825
I think you're right.

00:06:10.886 --> 00:06:13.128
Of course I thought it was something more exotic.

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:18.094
Right, it looked a little slime moldy, but I think it might be a decomposing leaf.

00:06:20.497 --> 00:06:22.760
I'm kind of using the pencil.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:29.307
My fingers are a little blunt.

00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:33.378
This looks like a different species of moss.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.921
This one looks like fern-like.

00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.003
That one looks a little more carpet-y to me.

00:06:39.584 --> 00:06:43.568
I like the language.

00:06:43.588 --> 00:06:44.148
Not really.

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.610
It's descriptive.

00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:48.653
That might even be a third.

00:06:51.836 --> 00:06:54.198
What about this speedy little grass?

00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:56.240
I think that's a different one than that.

00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:59.563
I think that's a third species.

00:06:59.898 --> 00:07:02.963
Oh, this guy just flew into our territory.

00:07:03.003 --> 00:07:04.365
Non-modal, Josh.

00:07:04.545 --> 00:07:04.825
Oh, OK.

00:07:04.845 --> 00:07:05.526
Thanks for the reminder.

00:07:06.348 --> 00:07:07.950
What was it, though?

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.973
I mean, it looked like a little.

00:07:09.993 --> 00:07:11.095
I don't see it.

00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:11.636
It's gone now.

00:07:11.736 --> 00:07:12.016
OK.

00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:13.258
Just here, just there.

00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:13.619
Just gone.

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:15.682
It's not an ant, too, but all right, non-modal.

00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:16.042
Yeah.

00:07:16.162 --> 00:07:16.984
Is this the same?

00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:18.306
I see what was happening.

00:07:18.326 --> 00:07:21.490
When you guys are done getting all your species, can you just bring them up to the sidewalk?

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.292
Sure.

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:22.632
Thanks.

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:48.501
yeah that looks a little I don't know that looks a little bit like this which I don't I didn't get a sample of but that's that's so tiny I don't know about that's just so small I'm not sure we can even pull that up I can't if you can get something out of that that might be a different

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:54.740
So how many have we got?

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.302
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven?

00:07:57.783 --> 00:07:58.283
Wait, no.

00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:00.945
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:08:01.046 --> 00:08:13.697
And this does look different than... I don't know, but it's the same.

00:08:14.778 --> 00:08:16.400
These might be the same.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.522
It's definitely different from that one.

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:23.711
Are you guys gonna be good?

00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.272
I think so.

00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:27.735
We've got eight species probably.

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:37.023
Nothing else is popping out at me.

00:08:37.043 --> 00:08:48.154
It's a pretty good amount though.

00:08:48.472 --> 00:09:10.632
So this is what I want you guys to do now.

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:16.259
I want you to look at your artifacts, and I want you to make observations on each one.

00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:19.303
Don't bother giving it a name yet, right?

00:09:19.763 --> 00:09:23.949
We're just trying to describe and discern the difference between the samples we collected.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.855
Write a little unique description for each, okay?

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:36.807
And if you want you can name them, but that will change as we get a group consensus out of it, okay?

00:09:36.827 --> 00:09:36.907
Yes?

00:09:36.927 --> 00:09:39.331
Sure, you can draw if you'd like as well.

00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:40.332
Does this point the right way?

00:09:40.902 --> 00:09:43.545
Um, I'm gonna set another timer for eight minutes.

00:09:43.946 --> 00:09:45.267
That may or may not be it.

00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:46.348
I'm done.

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:47.089
All right.

00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:49.152
I think we just got a bunch of footage here from your stomach.

00:09:50.353 --> 00:09:50.473
Great.

00:09:50.493 --> 00:09:50.613
Great.

00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:51.114
That's real nice.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:52.696
Let me know if you're confused.

00:09:52.716 --> 00:09:54.999
Okay, so main differences.

00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:58.843
Um, these kind of feather out more.

00:09:58.963 --> 00:09:59.764
Right.

00:09:59.784 --> 00:10:05.611
So I'll just... We've got kind of a feathery moss and kind of a carpety moss.

00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:07.213
Oh dear.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:37.757
I think that part yeah I think because that looks like something we were looking at earlier mm-hmm that little one so maybe all right thank you I don't know kind of hard to tell cuz they're so small

00:10:38.412 --> 00:10:39.654
Maybe that's a separate one.

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:40.596
I don't know.

00:10:40.616 --> 00:10:42.800
What do you think?

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.781
I am not the best.

00:10:46.887 --> 00:10:48.550
They look different.

00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.072
I think they're different.

00:10:50.473 --> 00:10:50.914
Okay.

00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:51.815
So we'll just make another.

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:56.203
One's a very small carpet.

00:10:56.243 --> 00:10:58.046
The other is very, or a larger.

00:11:00.491 --> 00:11:00.891
Yeah.

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:02.194
They kind of almost look spiky.

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:03.576
Like a little,

00:11:04.737 --> 00:11:33.428
little evergreen almost right yeah okay so i'm just gonna put skinny grass medium grass thick grass okay so that's plantain broadleaf plantain this is clover and then you said i said skinny medium and fat grass skinny medium thick grass i don't know is that eight yeah so and then

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:37.499
I just kind of went this way.

00:11:40.283 --> 00:11:42.165
Yep, that's good.

00:11:50.035 --> 00:11:59.246
Do you do this with your kids?

00:12:00.307 --> 00:12:01.289
Haven't yet.

00:12:01.309 --> 00:12:02.470
I've thought about trying it, but.

00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:09.341
We could probably do it at the end in that last next unit maybe, I think.

00:12:09.361 --> 00:12:12.866
It'd be a good workup to going out to the pond.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:13.166
Yeah.

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:17.712
So, you know how the lessons are kind of like, they're a lot shorter than their class length is.

00:12:18.513 --> 00:12:20.475
Are you just going to like, supplement the time?

00:12:20.535 --> 00:12:23.139
Are you talking bio one?

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:23.299
Mm-hmm.

00:12:23.319 --> 00:12:24.720
Okay.

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:32.110
Because I was thinking about maybe using like data classroom, whatever time's left over, instead of just like combining them, stuff like that.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.992
We'll get through that so quick if we do.

00:12:34.242 --> 00:12:35.103
I don't know, we'll see.

00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:39.487
Fall semester, I only have two honors.

00:12:40.027 --> 00:12:48.775
And so that's gonna be easy to like, let them, usually it's easy to let them get talking and you can take up a huge chunk.

00:12:48.795 --> 00:12:51.877
It's like one minute, good.

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.058
You guys need more than a minute.

00:12:53.499 --> 00:12:55.500
Right, like stick two of them together.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.304
How's two minutes now?

00:12:59.324 --> 00:13:02.126
How many minutes you need?

00:13:02.146 --> 00:13:03.287
I got tons of time.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:11.212
We got like 40 minutes.

00:13:11.232 --> 00:13:14.998
What do you need?

00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:16.380
Well, we don't have 20 minutes for you, Jill.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.061
Number 12.

00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:19.385
Get out of here, number 12.

00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:27.638
13 and 16.

00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:37.529
So remember, just when you're chilling and listening, based on your student level, you can do this at all sorts of different levels, right?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:51.664
You can go into this much detail that he's kind of orchestrating for higher, junior, senior level, and you can go as simple as middle school, which is literally what's different, take a picture of it, give it a letter, and why is it different, right?

00:13:51.684 --> 00:13:57.169
And then that's it, you're still identifying, you can still compare biodiversity and the species and everything.

00:13:57.149 --> 00:14:06.262
So I told the group over here that when I first did this with my juniors, we finished and they were like, that's it, that's all you want me to do?

00:14:06.443 --> 00:14:08.866
And I was like, okay, maybe that wasn't good enough.

00:14:08.886 --> 00:14:16.277
So you can hear I've been trying to make it a little bit more complex and I'm definitely gonna throw in what he's doing now to make it even more advanced.

00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:21.705
So yeah, pretty cool.

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:34.745
We're gonna go up there and stick a species and see if we found the same species.

00:14:42.844 --> 00:14:44.368
Yeah, one more will be perfect.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:15:00.486
I like doing that with the cars.

00:15:12.178 --> 00:15:16.262
We did that last year and

00:15:17.474 --> 00:15:23.103
Toyota had 73 and the second place had like 40 something.

00:15:24.085 --> 00:15:24.986
Did you do it for your AP class?

00:15:25.006 --> 00:15:30.195
Yeah.

00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:31.357
How are your scores of 501?

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.984
Below state average for the most part.

00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:37.687
Well, no, but no.

00:15:39.209 --> 00:15:40.832
Sorry, I'm thinking back to

00:15:41.116 --> 00:15:42.418
Spring there.

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:46.645
For fall they were both state and county average because I had honors.

00:15:46.685 --> 00:15:48.548
For fall they were definitely below.

00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:51.352
Fall I had CP.

00:15:52.233 --> 00:15:57.161
Sorry, fall I had honors, spring I had CP.

00:15:57.181 --> 00:16:04.913
Hey if you have your species ready there's still a couple groups working but everyone else you can come over here and you're gonna lay them out just kind of in this area here.

00:16:07.323 --> 00:16:10.205
Yeah, lay them out so everyone can see them.

00:16:10.225 --> 00:16:11.166
All right, clover.

00:16:11.186 --> 00:16:12.908
Yeah, and you can serve the categories though.

00:16:13.128 --> 00:16:15.490
This looks like the same grass.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.592
This looks like the same grass.

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:21.675
Yeah, let's spread them out a little bit.

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:23.697
Yeah, and then lay it down over there.

00:16:23.757 --> 00:16:28.041
Spread them out so everyone can see them.

00:16:28.081 --> 00:16:28.501
Ooh, okay.

00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.202
Oh, you got that.

00:16:29.262 --> 00:16:30.002
You got our third grass.

00:16:30.022 --> 00:16:30.182
Yeah.

00:16:30.202 --> 00:16:30.382
Plantain.

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:30.663
Plantain.

00:16:30.683 --> 00:16:31.543
That's a dandelion.

00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:32.604
Dandelion, oh.

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:34.646
Yeah, that looks like most of a dandelion leaf.

00:16:35.927 --> 00:16:35.987
Oh.

00:16:36.007 --> 00:16:36.908
And we've got

00:16:37.563 --> 00:17:02.963
three well no three different mosses we believe well move that one over so because it's the smallest here's the little whiskey okay i think i have a different grass he wasn't that was the different one right yeah he wasn't branching like these guys like i think maybe are these are you guys joining

00:17:03.803 --> 00:17:05.666
This thing doesn't like it if I lean over.

00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:07.889
I'm just wondering if that is the same kind of grass as this, just thinner.

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.852
All right, time is expired.

00:17:09.872 --> 00:17:11.054
We'll have to decide.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.436
So yeah, you're good at the moment.

00:17:13.357 --> 00:17:14.519
Lay out your samples.

00:17:15.641 --> 00:17:17.203
Do you guys see this tiny one right here, too?

00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:18.745
Mm-hmm.

00:17:18.765 --> 00:17:19.306
All right.

00:17:19.326 --> 00:17:19.947
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:22.130
David, we're kind of sampling over here.

00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:23.372
That's cool.

00:17:23.392 --> 00:17:23.632
OK.

00:17:25.756 --> 00:17:32.986
This one is a dandelion, so he's actually separate.

00:17:33.006 --> 00:17:33.507
One part with the flower.

00:17:34.904 --> 00:17:47.438
So as you guys bring over your samples, you'll be organizing and lumping them with their lights.

00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.361
There's like three different types of grass.

00:17:50.381 --> 00:17:54.486
There's like super wispy, medium, and super thick.

00:17:54.886 --> 00:17:58.831
Oh, is there a fourth one?

00:17:58.971 --> 00:18:02.515
Okay.

00:18:02.883 --> 00:18:05.505
Anybody else have this green flame tea grid?

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:07.247
No, I think that's a new one.

00:18:08.508 --> 00:18:11.971
It's okay, we have another board.

00:18:13.873 --> 00:18:15.815
Yeah, that's good.

00:18:15.835 --> 00:18:21.460
I think it's also labeled F on that sheet.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.581
Alright, we have all our samples.

00:18:28.046 --> 00:18:30.848
So, this is a really good way to get group consensus.

00:18:31.385 --> 00:18:43.297
By all means you don't have to do this and collect a class or multiple class data set, but there's a really good way to think about like, regardless of what you're doing, thinking about what kind of measurement uncertainty you're dealing with, right?

00:18:43.317 --> 00:18:46.981
So if you're measuring stem length, where are we measuring the radical from or whatever?

00:18:47.021 --> 00:18:58.152
So I like to group up students and as a group we come up with our rules so that we all are operating under the same protocol, so that when we collect all our data we can use it to run

00:18:58.537 --> 00:19:01.923
We have a higher sample size, we can run some descriptive statistics, right?

00:19:02.043 --> 00:19:03.466
We can get that bell curve.

00:19:03.486 --> 00:19:09.216
So... I think you might have some new ones.

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:17.049
This one right here looks like a completely different... Yeah, we've got some... The plantain goes there.

00:19:17.069 --> 00:19:21.557
And I don't think anybody else has the strawberry.

00:19:22.195 --> 00:19:29.546
Another reason why we chose to use the grass is because we're thinking in terms of school property.

00:19:29.867 --> 00:19:31.209
What do you have access to?

00:19:32.951 --> 00:19:34.574
So there's many directions you could take this.

00:19:34.594 --> 00:19:40.002
You could do like comparison between forest and lawn or just different places of the schoolyard.

00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:44.188
Maybe where one area of the schoolyard gets more sun exposure, right?

00:19:44.229 --> 00:19:44.869
Something like this.

00:19:45.671 --> 00:19:47.574
A lot of room to differentiate.

00:19:50.718 --> 00:19:51.139
So

00:19:54.038 --> 00:20:02.952
What we have lined up, what we're going to do again is, at this level, we're not going to name them, or we will, but we're just going to name them with a letter, okay?

00:20:03.553 --> 00:20:05.736
So this is where we start, right?

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:07.900
We have these birophytes.

00:20:09.142 --> 00:20:15.051
Perhaps I'll grab a couple samples of these, and I'll bring them to letter A.

00:20:15.453 --> 00:20:25.287
so that everyone will know when they do the random sampling what letter A looks like or what species or specimen letter A is.

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:26.288
Do you want us to write the species for you?

00:20:26.829 --> 00:20:32.417
Well, I think for now let's not do that because it'll take a little longer because not everyone has done that.

00:20:33.098 --> 00:20:44.734
But the next stage of this is looking at species A, once we have them all lined up, we will formulate our own description for each of our specimen, creating a key.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:45.540
Right?

00:20:46.021 --> 00:20:51.249
So in classrooms where I've done this, I've actually had a big whiteboard and it's all on one whiteboard.

00:20:51.269 --> 00:20:57.419
We tape a specimen and we write a little description, right, to help students along the way.

00:20:58.801 --> 00:21:04.309
What we did just now is we extrapolated this, right, and we transferred it amongst five different groups.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:18.818
Yeah, that's another thing too is like, what a great homework exercise, right?

00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:20.901
First you collect all the data.

00:21:21.321 --> 00:21:25.025
Maybe the next day you want to clean up the data and you want to use their names.

00:21:25.045 --> 00:21:29.450
Hey, perhaps at this stage everyone takes a picture of all the specimen they found.

00:21:31.192 --> 00:21:34.476
And then they go home and they try to give that name to it, right?

00:21:34.496 --> 00:21:40.843
Maybe it's genus species or maybe it's just a common name.

00:21:44.823 --> 00:21:47.858
Either or, that's not the premise.

00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:50.531
Whatever you think is best.

00:21:50.551 --> 00:21:53.787
But the next stage here is giving each one a description.

00:21:54.053 --> 00:22:01.445
I think the idea behind not giving a name right away also focused on knowing a name that we forget and take a picture of something.

00:22:01.926 --> 00:22:10.119
But like when we began out by the friendship circle, this is more about connecting and getting to know something through making a personal connection.

00:22:10.139 --> 00:22:12.143
That's why the descriptors are so important.

00:22:12.163 --> 00:22:15.488
Drawing that connection with students and stewardship in the land.

00:22:15.468 --> 00:22:26.192
When you meet someone, what's the first thing you usually learn about them is their name?

00:22:26.953 --> 00:22:28.617
And then how well do you know them?

00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:31.073
all you really know about them is their name.

00:22:31.153 --> 00:22:44.747
So when we're teaching kids about different species, there's a lot of benefit in learning the name eventually, but it's more interesting for them to really look at the organism and say, what makes this one different from that one?

00:22:44.847 --> 00:22:46.388
How do I know what's in this family?

00:22:46.428 --> 00:22:49.231
What similarities, what differences does it have?

00:22:49.251 --> 00:22:51.153
And then eventually they can learn the name.

00:22:51.173 --> 00:22:58.300
But just knowing the name of a plant doesn't always tell you that much about those species or the surrounding species.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:58.941
We'll play a name game later.

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:00.506
with people's names.

00:23:02.268 --> 00:23:17.010
So I think at this point, what we could do to continue modeling how you could do this in the classroom, can we come up with a general consensus for how to describe each of these viral fights here?

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.275
Like as a whole, how did you guys describe them in your groups?

00:23:20.295 --> 00:23:21.537
You've already done this.

00:23:22.023 --> 00:23:25.569
We have one, two, three, four, maybe five samples.

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:28.453
So we have five different unique ways of describing this.

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:31.277
Can we come up with the group consensus?

00:23:31.297 --> 00:23:33.020
Low, low, spiky.

00:23:34.062 --> 00:23:47.102
We got low, spiky.

00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:49.566
Well, spiky shape, soft texture.

00:23:51.807 --> 00:24:05.443
Maybe feathery more than spiky would be a... Does that sound good to us?

00:24:05.463 --> 00:24:09.127
Okay, then we move on to the next one.

00:24:09.348 --> 00:24:16.676
How would you describe this plant?

00:24:17.677 --> 00:24:18.338
Trilope.

00:24:20.798 --> 00:24:21.919
White flowers.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:22.840
White flowers.

00:24:23.922 --> 00:24:25.263
Ooh, white flowers.

00:24:27.085 --> 00:24:30.569
Fibrous roots.

00:24:30.589 --> 00:24:33.993
Fibrous roots.

00:24:34.013 --> 00:24:35.195
Ah!

00:24:37.257 --> 00:24:38.378
Green.

00:24:38.398 --> 00:24:43.945
Yeah, nice.

00:24:46.548 --> 00:24:46.688
Mm-hmm.

00:24:49.503 --> 00:24:57.053
Anybody else say something that we didn't hear?

00:24:57.073 --> 00:24:57.334
Feel free to.

00:24:57.354 --> 00:24:59.076
And if we look closer, I think like.

00:24:59.336 --> 00:25:09.250
Yeah, we could get into like the science stuff that students already know, right?

00:25:13.853 --> 00:25:18.240
And then, like, I think something else, like, you know this is clover, but how do you know it's clover?

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.822
By that, like, white little marking, right?

00:25:19.922 --> 00:25:20.363
Yeah, yeah.

00:25:20.383 --> 00:25:21.985
That's the type of clover, yeah.

00:25:22.005 --> 00:25:22.386
Yeah.

00:25:22.406 --> 00:25:23.007
Lots of clovers.

00:25:23.568 --> 00:25:29.737
So, that's that leaf white marking.

00:25:32.461 --> 00:25:33.443
Okay.

00:25:33.463 --> 00:25:37.829
So, let's move to C. We have arugula.

00:25:37.849 --> 00:25:38.090
What?

00:25:38.831 --> 00:25:40.053
Broadleaf plantain.

00:25:40.153 --> 00:25:41.415
All right, let's describe it.

00:25:41.455 --> 00:25:43.017
You have a bug bite you can chew it up and put it on it.

00:25:43.283 --> 00:25:43.824
Green.

00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:46.786
Broad oval leaf.

00:25:46.806 --> 00:25:48.048
Yeah, it's broad.

00:25:49.169 --> 00:25:50.910
It's clumps, growing clumps.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:26:00.380
Do any of them have their little spikes?

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:04.183
I was going to say, there's some of them that have the flower coming up.

00:26:04.223 --> 00:26:06.125
Yeah, here have a flower.

00:26:06.786 --> 00:26:08.908
Clumps.

00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:09.949
And then we could say,

00:26:12.747 --> 00:26:41.320
this is flower good description and it's where where is it located is it center in the center in center of clump of leaf clump it's clump i could add that in there it's clump it's clump it's clump all right what about the grass what about this one that's what color is it green

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.222
Tell me about the leaves.

00:26:43.242 --> 00:26:46.104
Skinny.

00:26:47.746 --> 00:26:48.607
Flat.

00:26:48.887 --> 00:26:53.031
What is it called when they come off one stem?

00:26:53.792 --> 00:26:54.232
Branching.

00:26:54.332 --> 00:26:55.093
Branching, yeah.

00:26:55.173 --> 00:26:55.553
Branching.

00:26:58.076 --> 00:27:00.778
It's also nice to get the students to touch each one, right?

00:27:00.959 --> 00:27:02.600
To feel like what that stem does.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.761
It clumps.

00:27:03.781 --> 00:27:09.106
Yes, those of you that have, we didn't have that one, so it clumps.

00:27:09.126 --> 00:27:10.868
Oh, absolutely.

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:16.845
There's a term for when the leaf is blade-like, when it's sword-like.

00:27:17.969 --> 00:27:23.085
It's a bladed leaf.

00:27:24.213 --> 00:27:32.826
I'm thinking of, like, gladiolas that are named after the Roman sword, but I feel like there's one that's a name for, like, the blade shape of grass, but I can't remember.

00:27:32.846 --> 00:27:34.368
Give it the blade shape of grass.

00:27:34.629 --> 00:27:45.225
This one looks like, if you compare these two, right, like that one looks like your quintessential grass at home or something, right?

00:27:45.245 --> 00:27:46.387
That's that blade of grass.

00:27:46.447 --> 00:27:49.191
What's this little light thing?

00:27:49.306 --> 00:27:50.828
Oh, we haven't done height.

00:27:51.109 --> 00:27:52.571
Height would be good.

00:27:54.273 --> 00:27:55.855
But that's something you could add in your class.

00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:57.658
You can measure all these things, too.

00:27:57.758 --> 00:28:01.323
So these have like a V-shaped, like, blade.

00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:06.431
Because they're going to have like a vein, a sedge.

00:28:06.851 --> 00:28:09.475
So, I mean, we can't write that because it's named, but.

00:28:13.387 --> 00:28:18.755
And I wouldn't, it's not a crump, but it's like a point.

00:28:18.775 --> 00:28:19.756
Yeah, it does.

00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:20.577
Clusters?

00:28:20.637 --> 00:28:21.338
Clusters, sure.

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:23.201
Small clusters.

00:28:24.483 --> 00:28:37.421
All right, other.

00:28:38.743 --> 00:28:41.908
OK, what time is it?

00:28:41.928 --> 00:28:42.769
10.22.

00:28:43.711 --> 00:28:55.543
Okay, so at this point I do, if it's okay, we can go back to the stuff that is included in the criteria.

00:28:55.944 --> 00:28:58.647
So, in your journals and thank you.

00:28:58.667 --> 00:29:00.589
Here's a better dandelion, more complete.

00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:01.149
Oh nice, yeah.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:09.398
So, no, make a note that A is this guy, B is this, C is this, D is this, E is this, and then any others that you may note.

00:29:09.378 --> 00:29:12.865
You're going to diagram out your quadrat.

00:29:12.885 --> 00:29:16.852
You're going to label where the A's are, where the B's are.

00:29:16.872 --> 00:29:20.319
You're going to have a little data table of how many you think you can find.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:29.496
And all of that is written under the criteria, and there's also descriptions and examples in there, okay?

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:35.114
So it's like the fourth page or something that says criteria, and then it says examples.

00:29:35.134 --> 00:29:42.784
You can go count first and then come back to match which path you have.

00:29:42.804 --> 00:29:43.384
That's true too, yeah.

00:29:43.404 --> 00:29:44.065
Yeah, I think either way.

00:29:44.085 --> 00:29:44.606
F is other.

00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:47.229
Yeah, that's just whatever else you find.

00:29:47.249 --> 00:29:52.856
There's a lot of, well, most of ours is F. Whiskey.

00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:54.799
That's because you went off the beaten path.

00:29:54.839 --> 00:29:57.142
Well, we went to the edge of it.

00:29:57.162 --> 00:29:58.964
All right, toss that Lulu Hoop somewhere.

00:29:58.984 --> 00:29:59.905
I did that on purpose.

00:30:00.121 --> 00:30:08.490
There's also little tiny mats you can sit on if you don't want to get wet.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.492
Yeah, move it.

00:30:11.133 --> 00:30:20.283
Now we're doing a total new random sample.

00:30:20.323 --> 00:30:29.773
This thing keeps falling on me.

00:30:31.407 --> 00:30:37.419
I don't know.

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:39.142
It's not growing there.

00:30:39.162 --> 00:30:40.505
I probably wouldn't.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:51.306
Alright, so... My hoop is slightly distended.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:02.681
All right.

00:31:02.701 --> 00:31:05.304
So, no, I forgot what A was.

00:31:05.565 --> 00:31:11.553
A was like all the moss.

00:31:13.555 --> 00:31:16.299
B was clover.

00:31:19.684 --> 00:31:30.258
C. C was like the plantain.

00:31:30.378 --> 00:31:30.759
Okay.

00:31:30.779 --> 00:31:31.840
C was plantain.

00:31:33.473 --> 00:31:36.338
Was B clover?

00:31:36.358 --> 00:31:37.159
I think that was.

00:31:38.341 --> 00:31:38.882
Uh, B is clover.

00:31:39.023 --> 00:31:39.443
Okay.

00:31:39.984 --> 00:31:45.073
D was the grass, broad grass.

00:31:47.677 --> 00:31:49.981
E was the skinny grass.

00:31:50.422 --> 00:31:52.145
And then you got C as the plantain?

00:31:52.165 --> 00:31:52.626
Yeah.

00:31:52.646 --> 00:31:53.027
Okay.

00:31:53.047 --> 00:31:53.948
And then F was?

00:31:54.249 --> 00:31:55.070
F was everything else.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.571
Anything else.

00:31:55.591 --> 00:31:55.791
Yeah.

00:31:56.713 --> 00:31:56.913
All right.

00:31:57.795 --> 00:31:57.895
Cool.

00:32:03.072 --> 00:32:29.109
See See see see see See see see See I'd say count well Yeah, I'd say count it.

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:30.231
It's over here.

00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:31.172
Isn't it see I

00:32:34.949 --> 00:32:58.375
another one yeah it is do count okay well a b c d e
