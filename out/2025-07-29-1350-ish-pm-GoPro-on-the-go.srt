1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:06,421
Here's the trail after a brief conversation.

2
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:09,465
Just looking at some of it.

3
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:11,648
It's called the West Prong Trail.

4
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:16,395
We have some kid right here who's in timeout at the moment.

5
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:18,158
They put me in timeout.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:38,121
see what happens when you don't follow expectations because i don't drop anything dumping water in his mouth oh so we hydrate our teammates okay you want to pour some water in my mouth one at a time just go buy a bucket who could squeeze squirt some water in my mouth

7
00:00:38,101 --> 00:01:05,222
Feel a little weird, but we can do it Forest trees last part Positive behaviors only see here's a trail up here that we're not going on but

8
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:22,789
it is very far up you can see some of the forestry on the left you see tree trunks the roots of trees that have fallen you see fungus

9
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,328
that have grown on tree limbs.

10
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:30,494
You see other fallen trees, mushrooms, things of that sort.

11
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:40,706
See the crew down here as they get themselves prepared for the adventure of hiking this wonderful trail.

12
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,451
We're going in groups of twos, as you may have heard.

13
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,556
Reach one, teach one, I believe is what it's called.

14
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:53,822
And as we do that, we will be learning from each other.

15
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:58,747
and also using our teaching skills to instruct each other.

16
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,998
And that is the tutorial.

17
00:02:02,143 --> 00:02:04,453
Probably everything for this video you can probably...

18
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,174
Yeah, you can edit it out or you can keep it.

19
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:17,342
But we are definitely going to have a fantastic time, even though that's not an educational word to use.

20
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:20,725
But we are currently in waiting.

21
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:28,393
So we're going to look around at some of the shrubbery, the forestry that we are in.

22
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:32,837
This trail right here, of course, is well traveled.

23
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:36,605
I'm not there by myself because it is not smart.

24
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,268
And we see a spider web right here.

25
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:47,775
Do not know what kind of spider that is, but I will not get close enough to find out because it is not healthy for a human.

26
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:52,459
We're going to back away and we're going to walk back down.

27
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,681
Oh, never mind.

28
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,342
We're going to stop here.

29
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,663
You see the algae on this tree?

30
00:02:57,924 --> 00:03:01,407
It is nice or fungus or both.

31
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:03,830
Could be a mix of both.

32
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:09,295
I believe those are mushrooms, some of that sort.

33
00:03:10,196 --> 00:03:12,418
Not mushrooms, but more probably fungus and whatnot.

34
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:31,495
So yeah, we're gonna walk back down to the bottom and show this huge park that we are engulfed in.

35
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,005
and to share with all of you who are gonna be watching the video.

36
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:39,647
So I will be back in a moment.

37
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,848
Oh, nevermind, scratch that.

38
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:41,549
I'm gonna stay on.

39
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,033
So I wanna go up a little more just because our team has not been called yet.

40
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:48,715
You see lots of forms of grass.

41
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:59,305
You see lots of vegetation that is growing about this forest, which,

42
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:03,234
is why they call the Great Smoky Forest or Great Smoky Mountains, rather.

43
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:14,454
Excuse my miss timing or miss naming it or misguiding the name I quoted.

44
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:16,939
But here we are.

45
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:21,677
So I'm going to stop here because I don't want to get lost in the forest.

46
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:30,329
But as we see, we have our other cohort on the film down below named Alicia.

47
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:37,799
And then we see that the rocks up here as part of the trail that we'll be walking.

48
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,703
I don't want to get too far to touch.

49
00:04:41,785 --> 00:04:45,610
So I'm going to go about right here where we have

50
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:53,465
Of course, the tree trunk has been uprooted, most likely by storm or just nature.

51
00:04:54,607 --> 00:05:12,954
As you can see, you can see how the roots have started turning into a different vegetation now that has been toppled, which means for the looks of it's toppled a long time ago.

52
00:05:12,994 --> 00:05:16,339
And with that being noted and said,

53
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,432
it then turns into something else.

54
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:38,462
So it like grows, not grows, but it molds itself into nature as it sinks, as it starts to be engulfed in the soil beneath it and becomes a different asset to nature.

55
00:05:43,572 --> 00:05:49,119
And up here, you see how the trail goes way up there, way up there.

56
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:57,611
It kind of has looks like it had like a wood railing to the right, down the camera to the left.

57
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,291
That's pretty cool.

58
00:05:59,233 --> 00:05:59,713
Pretty cool.

59
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:06,502
Now we'll head back down before my group leaves me because I just may do that.

60
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,486
We don't want that to happen.

61
00:06:11,249 --> 00:06:12,330
I'm going to come back down.

62
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:19,570
with society and I will reach out to you all shortly.
