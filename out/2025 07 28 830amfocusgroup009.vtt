WEBVTT

00:00:01.685 --> 00:00:02.488
Parking tag?

00:00:02.508 --> 00:00:02.708
Yeah.

00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:06.059
They probably won't tell me in the next half an hour.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.733
No, we have like academic tags we can get to from two-month staff.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.178
Well, they gave me a parking tag.

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:13.442
I just haven't run it down.

00:00:13.462 --> 00:00:14.445
Oh yeah, no I don't think so.

00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:19.790
Hey, good morning.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.970
Hi.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.812
What is your name?

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:21.372
I'm Tanya.

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:21.933
Hi.

00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:23.135
Oh, welcome.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.218
You know each other from Megabytes?

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:25.659
Yes.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.200
Yeah.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.321
Good to have you here.

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:29.044
A different project.

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:32.349
We'll talk a little bit about why we're here.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.875
Sorry to talk later, but thank you all for being here.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:37.056
Hi.

00:00:37.296 --> 00:00:38.037
Is it gone?

00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:38.478
All good.

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:44.126
Hey, did you hear by chance two days ago they reported two cases of lacrosse in Knox County?

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:44.787
No.

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:48.073
No, that was on the news.

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:50.178
We'll talk later.

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:57.036
But yeah, it's like it wasn't there at all during our project and they just announced it on the radio.

00:00:57.637 --> 00:01:00.244
Yeah, I was actually going to email her.

00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:08.902
Hi, my name is Amanda and I'm very happy to be here with you today.

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:11.725
I'm going to go through some like logistical stuff that I have to say.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.968
Thank you for being here today.

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:20.416
I'm going to be facilitating this focus group and I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts before we jump into the full experience of Tremont.

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:27.105
Today's conversation is a part of our research on how educators engage with data, place-based learning and probabilistic thinking.

00:01:27.685 --> 00:01:33.893
Since some of you are returning from year one and others are just joining, we want to take some time to understand where everyone is starting from.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:43.084
what prior experiences you've had, how you currently approach data or place-based practices, and what drew you to this PD in the first place.

00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:52.843
This is a chance to hear your stories, your questions, and what you're hoping to get out of the experience, and your insight will help us shape the program and better understand how to support teachers across different backgrounds.

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:57.820
So this session is being recorded so we can go back and accurately capture what was shared.

00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.483
It's only for research purposes.

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:04.911
Everything you say will be kept confidential, and we will remove names or identify details during analysis and reporting.

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:06.673
It's a voluntary conversation.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:14.385
You're welcome to skip any question or topic that doesn't feel relevant or that you'd rather not talk about, and you can leave the group at any time, no questions asked.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:22.797
To get us started, if you can just go around and share your name, your role, whether this is your first year with Project Credible or if you're returning,

00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:24.310
and your school.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.571
And we can start there.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:26.813
I'm Tanya.

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:30.158
This is my first year in this program.

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:38.190
I was interested because I've worked with Josh before on a frog ectotherm project.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.237
And I've worked with UT before with what he was talking about the megabytes is a mosquito study.

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:45.760
So I just like the collaborative work.

00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:47.142
So ectotherm ER?

00:02:47.823 --> 00:02:48.404
Was that last?

00:02:48.424 --> 00:02:48.664
Yes.

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:50.727
Yeah, I did that last summer.

00:02:50.747 --> 00:02:52.530
Yeah, I did it summer before last.

00:02:53.337 --> 00:03:03.889
I'm Justin this is my first year and I got emailed by another Knox County teacher out of the blue and thought that sounds kind of cool.

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:20.307
Teaching is my third or fourth career depending on how you count it and so I worked in zoos and aquariums before this and so getting people interested in anything related to animals and conservation is something that I want to look into and work with.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:21.907
I'm Lisa Jacobs.

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.790
I teach biology and anatomy at Hardin Valley.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:47.577
It's my first year with this project and I heard about it from Ann who works with Tremont and I've been really interested in finding more local sources of data, things to kind of tie my kids into local things that they care more about within my biology classes.

00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.023
I'm Allison Sieber.

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:52.326
I'm a student intern with Michelle here.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.109
She'll be my mentor at Farragut High School.

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:55.951
It'll be for ninth grade biology.

00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:59.615
I'm currently at UTK for grad school and science education.

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:04.561
I just got back for conservation work with jaguars and black bears.

00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:09.287
So she thought I would definitely enjoy this, especially being out in the Smokies.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:16.416
And I really just want to see how wildlife and conservation work in the Smokies can tie into teaching education.

00:04:17.392 --> 00:04:19.978
I'm Michelle Platt and I work at Farragut High School.

00:04:20.038 --> 00:04:23.205
I'm a ninth grade biology teacher and it's my second year with Tremont.

00:04:23.686 --> 00:04:29.419
I started the same as Lisa to try to integrate more place-based learning into my biology classes.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.105
I think it makes the students more interested.

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:34.590
The closer you can keep it to home.

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:35.917
Can we go around?

00:04:36.017 --> 00:04:37.278
How long have you taught?

00:04:37.438 --> 00:04:39.020
And you told us your school.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.181
So how long did you teach?

00:04:41.462 --> 00:04:42.884
Well, I've taught a lot of things.

00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:43.805
My husband was military.

00:04:44.065 --> 00:04:46.327
I've had my teaching degree for 13 years.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:53.555
I taught second, then third, then fifth, then eighth, and now I'm on my third year of ninth grade biology.

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:54.756
Nice.

00:04:54.776 --> 00:04:56.959
And you said that you're a student intern?

00:04:59.001 --> 00:04:59.101
Yeah.

00:04:59.121 --> 00:04:59.181
OK.

00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:05.067
I started teaching about 28 years ago, but this is my 15th year that I'm starting.

00:05:05.384 --> 00:05:06.785
teaching.

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:07.806
And what school are you at?

00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:08.607
Hardin Valley.

00:05:09.948 --> 00:05:18.276
I'm at Halls and this is my fourth full year, fifth year teaching biology, chemistry, and AP biology.

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:22.901
I've been teaching since 2003.

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:34.632
At Bearden I teach wildlife conservation, AP environmental, CP environmental, and AP research.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.330
Um, and like you, I was a zookeeper and it was zookeeping that got me into education.

00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:42.114
Yeah.

00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:46.765
I was like the only keeper that liked doing the talks with people.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:59.449
Well I mean there's a lot of varied experience here for sure and I'll tell you like I've been a teacher for a long time and now I want to be a zookeeper so maybe I can... It's a pay cut.

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:00.590
I got into teaching for the money.

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:14.207
No I've looked into it like because I grew up on a farm and had some experience with that I was like oh well you get to like be on animals all day.

00:06:14.608 --> 00:06:16.650
I started in research so this is my cut.

00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:26.986
So our first question is, before joining Project Credible, what experiences have you had with place-based education or teaching with community resources?

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:32.391
Why don't we start over there, because mine is mostly Project Credible.

00:06:33.312 --> 00:06:41.379
And you talked a little bit about Megabytes and... Yeah, just through UT really is how I've heard about all the collaborative opportunities.

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:46.283
The Megabytes was a mosquito research, and our students

00:06:47.478 --> 00:06:52.244
Um, literally set up mosquito traps to collect the eggs.

00:06:53.426 --> 00:06:56.650
So anyway, most of my, with the community has been through UT.

00:06:57.871 --> 00:07:01.075
Um, and then the frogs, the ectotherm ER.

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:06.983
Um, so it sounds like you jump on all the opportunities we have here as well.

00:07:07.403 --> 00:07:12.810
And that's where to me, I'm fortunate with the wildlife class, I don't have a state test.

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:15.387
I taught biology for 15 years.

00:07:15.427 --> 00:07:18.050
I'm so glad I'm over that.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.173
I mean, it's just the whole state testing thing.

00:07:21.494 --> 00:07:25.078
So I have the time to be able to do that where a lot of classes don't.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.806
And so, like she had said, I just like being able to connect my kids to things that are local.

00:07:32.087 --> 00:07:36.392
I bring students up here every year to Tremont for a weekend trip.

00:07:37.593 --> 00:07:38.494
And I don't know.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.931
Just Tremont's amazing.

00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:44.276
So anything that involves Tremont along with a collaboration with UT, I'm all in.

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:49.482
I don't know if they let schools borrow things, but we were all in on the ectotherm ER.

00:07:49.882 --> 00:07:52.225
Our curriculum's changing, but we bought a bunch of eye buttons.

00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:53.587
Okay.

00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:57.491
If you ever need to borrow them, I don't know if they let them let us swap out.

00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:58.532
I know Bartlett.

00:07:58.752 --> 00:08:02.136
He was at Bearden for over a decade.

00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:04.210
I'm sure Bartlett would allow it.

00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:05.632
Yeah, as long as they came back.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.253
They're expensive.

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:06.854
Of course.

00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:08.636
So, who else?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.079
What else kind of community?

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.442
I'm fairly new to teaching.

00:08:12.462 --> 00:08:14.245
Like I said, this is my fourth full year.

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:22.757
This will be my third year teaching AP Biology, and so I'm trying to incorporate more

00:08:22.737 --> 00:08:23.838
hands-on experience with that.

00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:32.166
We go to a local beaver pond out there on Norris Freeway, right there next to the Walmart, and we do a stream survey, but it's like a one-day thing.

00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:51.985
I'm trying to work up to getting more students so that I can maybe do something like coming out here, or when I was in high school I went to the, it's now called the Chesapeake Bay Field Station down in Wallops Island, Virginia, and did like a weekend of field ecology and intertidal zones, and that's kind of why I ended up working in aquariums for 15 years.

00:08:51.965 --> 00:08:58.653
And so doing that stuff and getting into that and trying to incorporate more of that into my teaching.

00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:03.038
You should look for Fishy Climate next spring with Dr. Zingley.

00:09:03.819 --> 00:09:04.820
You'd like that one too.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.842
It's about stream surveys and such.

00:09:09.345 --> 00:09:18.175
We have started bringing a few classes up to the Smokies for their, like we do salamanders and lichen counts.

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:42.556
for like an afternoon and we've done a lesson with the Chesapeake Bay which is not local but it's the kids really enjoy it even though it's not here having that place to kind of be like oh something attached to that data that we've done that has gone really well so I'd love to see something even closer that they can identify with.

00:09:42.996 --> 00:09:43.757
Awesome.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:10:08.563
So I obviously have not taught anybody or anything like that but I think for my own education what I would try to do is I knew my interests were in like wildlife and biology so I took classes at Scholl's Marine Laboratory and it's where undergrads or anybody who's wanting to take a college level course is able to access the first marine lab in the US and it's off the coast of Maine at Appledore Island.

00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:12.651
And it's just like nestled with a bunch of islands, but you're at a field station.

00:10:12.671 --> 00:10:23.967
It really focuses on conservation and it like tries to have a lot of diverse professors from different institutions that do like their own research, or maybe they're just not even professing anymore.

00:10:24.047 --> 00:10:28.514
And they're like actually out in the field working and they'll come and teach classes for about two weeks.

00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:32.760
So I was able to take like field animal behavior and shark biology and conservation.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:33.861
So it was really cool.

00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:35.023
I got to meet like.

00:10:35.408 --> 00:10:39.934
Two of the most renowned like shark biologists are doing stress physiology on the blood work of sharks.

00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:41.977
We didn't get any sharks.

00:10:42.317 --> 00:10:49.246
So that was a bummer, but it's like, they like try to like broadcast it for like a wide range of students.

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:50.308
And it was very interesting.

00:10:50.368 --> 00:10:54.453
I got to meet a lot of students from Cornell university and university in New Hampshire.

00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:55.054
Cool.

00:10:56.198 --> 00:11:02.831
I am in my second year of Tremont, and as I've said, I've acquired a lot of different classes.

00:11:02.891 --> 00:11:12.891
I've gone to Fishy Climate with Dr. Zingley, and then I did the ectotherm ER through UT, as well as Tremont last year.

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:21.744
I feel like a lot of us are interested in place-based learning and bringing the kids to conservation because of experiences we've had.

00:11:22.124 --> 00:11:34.422
Like I can remember in elementary school going to a nature's classroom and we spent a week there and there's a lot, I'm from New England, so we did a lot of sea-based stuff as well that was all place-based.

00:11:35.023 --> 00:11:37.106
And I think maybe those things just stuck with me.

00:11:37.566 --> 00:11:40.110
And so if you teach kids

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:46.518
early on about where they live, it stays with them, whether they realize it or not.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.401
It's very connected.

00:11:48.421 --> 00:11:49.081
You're saying it's relevant.

00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:50.343
Yeah, makes you connected.

00:11:50.523 --> 00:11:52.966
Yeah, it's very relevant.

00:11:52.986 --> 00:11:53.086
Cool.

00:11:53.107 --> 00:11:58.433
Again, a lot of varied experiences with like PlaySpace, lots of different critters and watersheds.

00:12:00.656 --> 00:12:04.361
Now let's do a little switch over to data and data literacy and working with data.

00:12:04.821 --> 00:12:09.287
So how have you approached data literacy or working with data in your classroom so far?

00:12:10.837 --> 00:12:25.715
me personally, I, unfortunately, time wise, I tend to get a data set that's already made, like one I find online, like, more study and range of tolerance.

00:12:26.596 --> 00:12:30.221
There are these really cool data sets about two different fish.

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:36.148
And, you know, this fish can survive at low temperatures, this fish survives at high temperatures.

00:12:36.228 --> 00:12:38.090
And so the data sets already there.

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:39.612
And

00:12:39.878 --> 00:12:47.591
allowing the students to be able to interpret data, try to figure out from the data table what's happening.

00:12:48.272 --> 00:12:58.469
And then I use Google Sheets to have them input the data and then highlight it and turn that into a graph.

00:12:59.751 --> 00:13:02.916
And so they can visualize the data.

00:13:02.997 --> 00:13:05.601
but they're not coming up with it.

00:13:06.122 --> 00:13:19.866
I just, I haven't found, other than the wildlife class, with other classes, I feel like I don't have the time to actually do the experiment, to collect the data, then to analyze the data.

00:13:19.946 --> 00:13:22.090
I just, it's too time restrictive.

00:13:23.031 --> 00:13:28.701
But having good data sets that might already be out there from the Smokies,

00:13:29.002 --> 00:13:38.693
and just bringing that in and then being able to look and analyze, you know, what's happening to our population of salamanders?

00:13:38.853 --> 00:13:42.217
Is the fungus that's affecting frogs affecting salamanders?

00:13:42.297 --> 00:13:51.988
And having data that's already there for them to analyze would be very helpful to me, but that's how I tend to use it.

00:13:54.415 --> 00:13:58.761
There's been a switch recently in Knox County towards storylines.

00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:02.366
In fact, we're going all storylines with the new biology curriculum.

00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:10.517
And a lot of those include controlled lab situations where they generate data and they have to graph the data.

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:16.084
And so there's some of that with biology, particularly the honors classes that I teach.

00:14:16.184 --> 00:14:18.447
It's a little more limited with the CP classes.

00:14:19.228 --> 00:14:21.351
But with AP biology, it's a lot of

00:14:22.175 --> 00:14:26.539
25% of the time is supposed to be lab time, 25% of the class, rather.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:45.617
And so between osmosis and all of the data that we need to generate and chi-squared and all of these things, standard deviation, all of these labs that we do working toward understanding those numbers, they generate their data, they analyze their data, they graph their data, and working on that is primarily where we use it.

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:50.342
But like I tell the kids in my biology class, so much of the state test is

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.602
reading and understanding what they give you.

00:14:53.622 --> 00:14:55.455
You don't have to memorize

00:14:55.942 --> 00:15:02.070
science facts, you have to be able to read a graph or read a paragraph and pull out the pertinent data.

00:15:02.611 --> 00:15:05.955
And so it's not just true for the state test, it's true for the ACT.

00:15:06.035 --> 00:15:10.140
If you take the science portion, it's all reading and comprehension and graph.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.308
And so being able to use that is an important tool that I like to try and press on them.

00:15:16.448 --> 00:15:24.058
And so, especially with the storylines, they've been getting more and more graph reading and literacy and understanding and interpreting these graphs.

00:15:25.388 --> 00:15:32.747
Yeah, I would, I mean that's just a great compilation of all the things that I feel like is going on in my room.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:42.452
Having that data because we don't, there's just not time to be able to collect all the data and have a robust sort of data set so.

00:15:42.432 --> 00:15:54.488
Definitely what attracted us to the Chesapeake Bay story was the data that they had that was just, there it is, we can look at it, we can graph it, we can try to make sense of it.

00:15:54.568 --> 00:16:05.402
So again, going back to that idea of looking at what you have and being able to make sense of it and pull meaning out of it has definitely been our focus.

00:16:06.918 --> 00:16:09.361
So for me, once again, was not a teacher.

00:16:09.421 --> 00:16:18.751
However, I think from what I recall in high school, I had no exposure to anything really with data, doing graphs or anything like that.

00:16:18.831 --> 00:16:28.001
It was just like definition based the entire time and then just regurgitating the information out on the test and then like expecting good results that way.

00:16:28.342 --> 00:16:33.828
So safe to say, I don't recall anything from biology in undergrad or not undergrad in high school.

00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:36.891
And then I got exposure in college

00:16:37.563 --> 00:16:40.186
became in my opinion, data like literate.

00:16:40.406 --> 00:16:41.047
I could read it.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.990
I could pull information from the paragraph, understand models.

00:16:44.491 --> 00:16:50.958
And then I got better at it actually this summer because I worked in an actual carnivore lab and doing like all the data stuff.

00:16:50.978 --> 00:16:57.045
And I got exposure to Excel, um, knowing like how like formulas work and like that.

00:16:57.065 --> 00:17:00.068
But unfortunately in high school, no exposure really whatsoever.

00:17:00.388 --> 00:17:03.552
And that was eight years ago, I think.

00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:03.672
Yeah.

00:17:04.985 --> 00:17:11.058
I definitely agree with the time crunch, but I disagree with just using crunched data sets.

00:17:11.239 --> 00:17:17.632
I think part of the kids taking ownership is getting some of that data itself.

00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:24.327
Though when they get their own data, the big problem is them learning how to use whatever

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:33.487
data analytic you're using, whether it be data classroom or Google Sheets, getting the kids to learn how to function in that.

00:17:34.048 --> 00:17:42.236
But I think when it's their own data, they have more buy-in, and I like to try to get them doing as much of it themselves.

00:17:43.737 --> 00:17:55.208
We do have a lot of data that we are already given, and we do canned graphs and interpreting graphs, but I like to make sure that I build in labs where they're collecting their own data.

00:17:56.302 --> 00:17:59.526
Well, and the next question, we've kind of covered this at the beginning.

00:17:59.967 --> 00:18:07.155
Is there anything that you all want to add about why you decided to participate in Project Credible and what you're hoping to gain?

00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:10.820
So we talked a little bit when you introduced yourself about like why you're here.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:16.487
Is there anything else you want to add to that about why you chose this and why you hope to get out of it?

00:18:19.673 --> 00:18:37.619
I'd like to get a field experience that I can bring my AP bio students for and like figure out like maybe maybe I can find something around here that we can work on because as it is I take them for like a three-hour trip to a beaver pond which is you know pretty nice but there's a lot more we could do.

00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:40.823
You're in the right place for that.

00:18:41.424 --> 00:18:47.773
You know I would like to know too if there like with the exotherm ER that we did

00:18:48.766 --> 00:19:00.101
knowing, like being, I guess being given a project where we could make those frogs, take the temperatures, collect that data, like having something- Contribute to something bigger.

00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:00.962
Yeah.

00:19:01.823 --> 00:19:17.423
And plus that gave, instead of having to spend the time to go out and find all the research, if there's something that could say, hey, we need help with this and help me focus to help my students and say, this is what we need help with.

00:19:17.463 --> 00:19:18.705
Here's what you could do.

00:19:19.495 --> 00:19:24.404
And they really like that that was connected to a larger problem that they were actually contributing to that data.

00:19:24.504 --> 00:19:25.466
They like to contribute.

00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:28.211
They like to feel like what they're doing is meaningful.

00:19:28.572 --> 00:19:30.836
Like citizen science projects.

00:19:30.856 --> 00:19:31.817
Yes, exactly.

00:19:32.138 --> 00:19:32.819
Exactly.

00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:34.843
Well, again, right place.

00:19:35.564 --> 00:19:37.588
We're in the best place for that, right?

00:19:38.041 --> 00:19:42.967
The last thing I have is a statement on whether you agree or disagree and how you feel about it.

00:19:43.888 --> 00:19:51.878
Some people might say that things like place-based learning and data science are nice extras in the science class, but that learning science is really about understanding universal concepts.

00:19:51.938 --> 00:19:53.220
How do you feel about that statement?

00:19:55.543 --> 00:19:56.564
I don't think it's extra.

00:19:56.824 --> 00:20:02.091
I think it's part of the universal concepts of science is that idea of

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:09.877
What are I mean, none of that other stuff would be there if we weren't collecting any data and working with that data and taking meaning from that data.

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:11.741
Science isn't isolated.

00:20:12.523 --> 00:20:13.887
You need to make connections.

00:20:13.987 --> 00:20:17.796
Science is all about connecting with the natural world and understanding it better.

00:20:17.956 --> 00:20:19.540
I don't think you can separate the two.

00:20:22.945 --> 00:20:46.270
I know for me when we would learn things that were like more personal to our area it like made me feel more connected with the not just the community but also like science and for me I was more engaged with my learning so they give us something about the Smokies I was like oh that's like I live right there like I just now recently learned about the synchronous fireflies I had no clue and I'm like that's cool that's like on my doorstep so

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:54.681
Like, place-based learning is something I never really got too much, and I think it would be very interesting to learn on how to, like, do an education matter behind it.

00:20:57.905 --> 00:20:58.967
Okay.

00:20:58.987 --> 00:20:59.828
Well, thank you.

00:20:59.868 --> 00:21:01.590
Is there anything else we want to add?

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.992
That's all I've got for today.

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:06.356
Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today.

00:21:06.396 --> 00:21:11.363
The recording and transcript will be kept on the university's Google Drive and will be password protected.

00:21:11.423 --> 00:21:15.208
If you have any questions, just feel free to contact me or Dr. Rosenberg.

00:21:15.228 --> 00:21:15.328
Josh.

00:21:16.287 --> 00:21:18.214
Thank you Commander Josh.
