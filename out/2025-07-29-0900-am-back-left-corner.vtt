WEBVTT

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:29.768
Yeah, I look at

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:23.921
Yeah, in addition, I was thinking even like transitioning from like a outdoor field experience to like even a lab bench experience, like maybe testing the mold in the school or something, you know?

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:34.433
Grow some mold on plates.

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:45.672
There comes the question, what does

00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:47.165
related to students.

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:53.693
Then what does a place-based science lesson can be?

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.535
What can you integrate there?

00:02:56.136 --> 00:03:02.845
How do you use the place in your science class?

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:09.753
Or your places?

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:10.975
In terms of data,

00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:19.378
First-hand data, second-hand data.

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:19.879
How would you use those?

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:20.481
How do you think about those?

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.986
Well, like we said, the place is where you are, right?

00:03:23.006 --> 00:03:28.879
So place-based data or place-based lessons, being curious about where you are.

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:45.602
Students are asking questions about their school yard, their community, the river flow next by.

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:15.579
for it and where you can find the place for you.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:25.030
Next, I'm going to hand pass time to pass the stage to our teachers.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.171
Is Josh, are you talking for a second?

00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:26.451
Oh, no.

00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:27.332
Good morning, everybody.

00:04:28.073 --> 00:04:31.217
Sorry to run around with all the cameras.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:35.001
This is for our motion picture movie coming out soon.

00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:38.104
Incredible Hulk.

00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:39.546
Incredible Hulk.

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:40.547
The Incredible Hulk.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.792
Ooh.

00:05:40.012 --> 00:05:43.272
term on its own, but it's less intimidating than the term

00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:34.502
what we knew about and what we know about pandemics.

00:09:51.128 --> 00:09:51.629
I'm not sure.

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:52.853
I don't really know.

00:09:52.873 --> 00:09:56.643
These are all probabilistic terms that we can use.

00:09:56.864 --> 00:10:00.033
And maybe part of what you could do is find language that works for your students.

00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:01.297
Probably 96% confident.

00:10:01.457 --> 00:10:03.402
That's kind of not accessible.

00:10:03.423 --> 00:10:05.067
But maybe I'm not sure.

00:10:05.107 --> 00:10:06.471
I'm a little sure.

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:48.415
the needle.

00:10:50.257 --> 00:10:51.599
So, um, okay.

00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:54.322
So thanks, David.

00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:57.366
Um, so, so this was just a like, basically a worksheet.

00:10:57.386 --> 00:10:59.949
We're not in kind of like everything in this project.

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:12.445
This is sort of an initial design effort from Amanda, actually, she taught with this with her students last year in block County, I forget Amanda's Eagleton.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:14.207
But part of what we're hoping is in

00:12:26.598 --> 00:12:30.835
So for now, we just want to share this with you.

00:12:31.699 --> 00:12:35.072
In a subsequent one of those days we asked you about

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:45.536
Last thing I swear is we don't want this to be intimidating.

00:14:45.557 --> 00:14:47.170
We want part of our job is to try to figure out

00:15:07.484 --> 00:15:19.967
I would also prefer if you don't look through it.

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:24.415
Yeah, don't look through it.

00:15:25.396 --> 00:15:29.644
Make sure you have a writing utensil and then we're gonna be

00:15:38.753 --> 00:15:42.296
Anybody need a clipboard or a notebook or a pencil before we get started?

00:15:42.997 --> 00:15:43.718
Show me thumbs up.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.319
I've got my utensils.

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:45.940
Thumbs down.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.465
I need someone to come help me get my utensils.

00:15:51.966 --> 00:15:52.706
All right, cool.

00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:59.473
So before we start doing science, I want us to revisit our norms, because it's first thing in the morning.

00:15:59.533 --> 00:16:03.997
So if you could all turn to your left, to my right, over towards where Catherine is.

00:16:05.058 --> 00:16:08.001
And can I get someone to read the first norm for us?

00:16:08.977 --> 00:16:10.920
Be open to something new.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:11.240
Thanks.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.962
Can someone read me the second one?

00:16:12.982 --> 00:16:16.547
Choice.

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:19.331
Making a space to encourage being brave.

00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:20.392
All included in her communication.

00:16:22.956 --> 00:16:24.298
Growth.

00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:26.441
Valuing input.

00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:27.142
Thank you.

00:16:27.162 --> 00:16:32.068
So I would love for y'all to take one minute.

00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:32.689
I'll set a timer.

00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:51.420
I want you to take a second and reflect either in your head or on your paper how yesterday you followed one of these norms and then how today you could incorporate one of these norms, maybe step outside the comfort zone a little bit.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:21.063
Can y'all still see to write if the lights are like this?

00:18:21.403 --> 00:18:25.247
I'd love to hear from two people if anyone is interested in sharing.

00:18:25.347 --> 00:18:34.636
How are you looking forward to practicing any of these?

00:18:34.777 --> 00:18:37.159
How did you practice it yesterday or how are you looking

00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:52.043
I really enjoyed helping Jen be brave enough to catch herself.

00:19:15.293 --> 00:19:36.694
So I really love this activity I always like as I've mentioned I do something really similar with sixth graders every year and I have them come up with their own norms for themselves but also for me and we hang them on the board and we revisit them regularly and it's a lot easier for me to say like you said this is how you wanted to be treated

00:19:41.905 --> 00:19:56.356
We're going to get started.

00:19:57.499 --> 00:19:58.902
We have new standards.

00:20:16.702 --> 00:20:25.510
to one of the disciplinary core ideas in science and the science and engineering practices of like unity and diversity among living things.

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:46.489
So even if you don't have a standard that says the word biodiversity in it, which is what we're gonna be talking about today, I encourage you to like really dig deep and think about how you could incorporate some of these ideas and specifically discussions around the experiment and around experimentation with your students.

00:20:49.186 --> 00:20:52.750
you're still talking about the interconnectedness between.

00:20:58.518 --> 00:21:02.183
OK, so this is just a turn and talk real quick.

00:21:02.244 --> 00:21:03.686
We'll do another just one minute.

00:21:04.126 --> 00:21:06.290
How do you use data in your life outside of school?

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.433
So we're not talking school at this point.

00:21:08.973 --> 00:21:14.261
And then what kind of data would a scientist need to collect in order to know how healthy an ecosystem is?

00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:23.094
So spend like 15 seconds on this one, like how do you use data outside of school, and then like 45 seconds on that one.

00:21:23.114 --> 00:21:25.538
All right, so turn and talk.

00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:45.484
I always use

00:22:09.798 --> 00:22:11.240
Yeah.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.726
What kind of data would a scientist need to collect in order to know?

00:22:14.786 --> 00:22:17.029
Bioindicators, yeah.

00:22:17.049 --> 00:22:21.135
So counting water systems and everything that's in the water.

00:22:21.416 --> 00:22:22.618
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:22.938 --> 00:22:23.238
Totally.

00:22:23.299 --> 00:22:26.724
And then we'll talk about some of that, too.

00:22:26.744 --> 00:22:27.886
Soil data, yeah.

00:22:27.906 --> 00:22:28.647
Water quality.

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:29.268
But how?

00:22:29.708 --> 00:22:30.770
Presence of water.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.272
How do you know?

00:22:32.493 --> 00:22:36.058
And then you could, like, water quality and stuff like that, too.

00:22:41.607 --> 00:22:53.105
So we've talked about data a little bit, so let's just start going into this idea of how do we know, so for the next few hours, how do we know how healthy an ecosystem is?

00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:59.275
And I know that once again, your teachers and some of us have taught all of these things, but that's where we're going.

00:22:59.295 --> 00:23:04.223
So if you don't know richness versus heaveness, this is a very common picture that I've used

00:23:07.358 --> 00:23:09.081
So richness and evenness.

00:23:10.063 --> 00:23:16.875
So just think to yourself about what the root of those words mean before you even think about it with the word species, right?

00:23:17.937 --> 00:23:22.566
So evenness is how things are, how would you say evenness?

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:25.371
Okay, yeah.

00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:29.198
So richness is number of species.

00:23:32.097 --> 00:23:35.274
So evenness is the distribution, okay?

00:23:35.817 --> 00:23:39.154
So when we're thinking about biodiversity, we can think about species even

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:35.635
the biodiversity in the area based on the niches and niches available I don't know how you say it in Michigan I said niche and now I say niche so whatever whatever it is so yeah absolutely so I want you to just think for a second is biodiversity and you can write it if you want or just think is biodiversity necessary to have a healthy ecosystem so just think for a second

00:24:41.302 --> 00:24:41.788
Alright.

00:24:43.147 --> 00:24:44.241
Does anyone want to say what they think?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.701
Okay, beautiful.

00:25:16.721 --> 00:25:18.043
So that's, we've got that mindset.

00:25:18.063 --> 00:25:21.406
Here we go.

00:25:21.426 --> 00:25:28.274
So we were thinking with that species evenness and richness components, how healthy is our local ecosystem?

00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:40.487
So think back to Knoxville and they are, there's lots of places where we have people go out and we're paying to remove honeysuckle or we are going out volunteering to remove honeysuckle, right?

00:25:41.688 --> 00:25:43.270
With our

00:25:44.667 --> 00:25:48.414
IB science juniors, we are working together with IAMS.

00:25:48.995 --> 00:25:51.880
And IAMS is focusing on bird scat.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.425
Is it really worth the time to remove all these invasives?

00:25:54.565 --> 00:25:55.507
Is it helping the birds?

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:56.428
Is it hurting the birds?

00:25:56.468 --> 00:26:02.539
What kind of biodiversity, like is the biodiversity changing on its own and should we interfere with that, right?

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:06.827
And then also kind of like this bamboo interdependence.

00:26:11.498 --> 00:26:13.260
dies, they all die.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.243
So then what happens for that ecosystem?

00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:20.046
Any thoughts on these things?

00:26:20.186 --> 00:26:22.789
How can we get the monsters?

00:26:22.889 --> 00:26:25.892
Well, we have bamboo, too, so we can't forget about those ones.

00:26:25.952 --> 00:26:27.954
But invasive bamboo.

00:26:27.974 --> 00:26:35.000
But yeah, so just be thinking about what really makes biodiversity, what really makes a healthy ecosystem.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.982
All right, so once again, I showed you guys this yesterday.

00:26:37.483 --> 00:26:39.885
I have the luxury of having these two particular standard

00:26:43.257 --> 00:26:46.120
So this is my kiddos out in the native plant garden.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:27:04.819
You can see it's not growing very much at this point, but we could still go out and we could look at the remnants from last year, or we could look at what is starting to sprout this year and have these little quadrats and figure out the population abundance using different sampling strategies.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.902
Can you say what a quadrat is?

00:27:07.922 --> 00:27:08.643
Yeah.

00:27:08.663 --> 00:27:12.927
So I think it's just IB that says

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:29.447
quadra as well okay I couldn't I didn't know so quadra is like a quadrant of land could be a circle square yeah we use circles just could be this coral reef hula hoops are easy so yeah okay

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:31.632
All right, thank you.

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:33.696
So this is what Josh was talking about a little bit.

00:27:33.736 --> 00:27:36.901
So just a moment ago, I said, think about like back in Knoxville, right?

00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:43.732
And think about items and think about like how we work to try and make that ecosystem more healthy in our minds, right?

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:47.238
But now I want you to think about just outside here.

00:27:48.961 --> 00:27:50.603
Okay, so we've been walking around for a day.

00:27:51.204 --> 00:27:52.667
So how healthy is this ecosystem?

00:27:52.707 --> 00:27:57.274
So just think to yourself, account for what you already know,

00:28:16.441 --> 00:28:17.762
We can do a feeling of place.

00:28:18.863 --> 00:28:21.345
When we do all those things, we can account for what we know.

00:28:23.808 --> 00:28:26.971
So think about how healthy is the ecosystem outside based on what you know.

00:28:33.657 --> 00:28:38.641
So we're going to ask you guys, based on what you know, be open to new evidence as we go out.

00:28:38.901 --> 00:28:40.082
So what do you know at this point?

00:28:40.122 --> 00:28:43.065
What do you see when we get out there and assess the biodiversity in our hula hoops?

00:28:43.706 --> 00:28:45.327
And then consider your confidence.

00:28:45.347 --> 00:28:46.228
What is your level of confidence?

00:28:47.795 --> 00:28:50.077
we could come back in and start this again, right?

00:28:50.137 --> 00:28:51.058
And account for what we know.

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:52.639
Be open to new evidence.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.460
Consider your evidence.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.024
And that's what we're going to do with Jen's lesson here in just a little bit, OK?

00:28:57.044 --> 00:29:00.867
So we're doing more terrestrial, and then they're doing more aquatic.

00:29:01.608 --> 00:29:03.750
So just think about that as we go through those lessons today.

00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:07.113
All right, to your paper.

00:29:08.594 --> 00:29:12.378
I would prefer if you don't flip around at the moment, because there's some hints ahead.

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:13.379
I just printed it all.

00:29:13.419 --> 00:29:15.861
Normally, I have this on Canvas, and it's like, click there.

00:29:17.663 --> 00:29:21.608
So the two standards are at the top, and that's just for me.

00:29:21.628 --> 00:29:25.072
You can change those to whatever standards you'd like if you want to use this exact same activity.

00:29:25.973 --> 00:29:34.363
And I used to start off, the only reason I did species richness and evenness for you guys is because I would have already done that for the students so that they have that background knowledge.

00:29:34.803 --> 00:29:39.469
But otherwise, I used to tell them this objective.

00:29:39.489 --> 00:29:47.518
By the end of the day, you should be able to evaluate population abundance of a non-modal species, which can be estimated using random sampling, systematic sampling, or transect sampling.

00:29:48.342 --> 00:29:49.103
rattle that off.

00:29:49.303 --> 00:29:51.606
And then it'd be like, all right, who knows what this word means?

00:29:51.706 --> 00:29:52.907
Who knows what this word means, right?

00:29:52.927 --> 00:29:53.849
Because that's the objective.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:59.956
So then last year, with the mindset of Project Credible, I started to put a little bit more of this on the students.

00:30:00.116 --> 00:30:10.208
So for more of like them dissecting the objective and them modeling what they think this is going to look like before we go outside, rather than me telling them what it's going to look like before we go outside.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.333
So on the front of your paper,

00:30:14.313 --> 00:30:19.960
I have first dissect the objective, and this is exactly what I do with my students, so don't be, think I'm talking down to you, okay?

00:30:20.781 --> 00:30:25.147
So first, dissect the objective and try to define each of the underlined words using only your brain.

00:30:26.188 --> 00:30:26.388
Alright?

00:30:26.609 --> 00:30:32.116
So let's take a minute, look at the objective, look at the underlined words, just write down whatever you think they mean.

00:30:32.977 --> 00:30:35.680
If you know them, that's cool, if you don't, put, I don't know that word.

00:31:15.738 --> 00:31:45.357
You.

00:32:11.611 --> 00:32:18.126
All right, just for the sake of time, and so we can get outside here shortly, now go ahead and go to the second part.

00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:21.594
Join your shoulder partner or group mates and see if you came up with similar definitions.

00:32:21.754 --> 00:32:23.358
So just talk about what you wrote down.

00:32:24.019 --> 00:32:26.886
If you knew one that they didn't, then go ahead and talk with them about that.

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:43.134
I'm not moving.

00:32:43.154 --> 00:32:43.635
That's easy.

00:32:43.975 --> 00:32:46.639
Estimated a guess with mathematical backing.

00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:47.040
OK.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:49.563
That's your prior knowledge or gathered information.

00:32:49.583 --> 00:32:53.689
So for the ones that you didn't get to, do you have any guesses for how you would define those words?

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:58.436
Like random for me is something, because random is random.

00:32:58.477 --> 00:32:59.057
Right.

00:32:59.198 --> 00:33:03.524
How did you put that material?

00:33:04.586 --> 00:33:09.613
I didn't do that one, because it was easier to write what a transect was, and I ran out of time.

00:33:17.828 --> 00:33:22.916
just be maybe walking around the area counting.

00:33:24.798 --> 00:33:28.183
Systematic and transect seems to be similar.

00:33:28.544 --> 00:33:31.028
Like transect is a systematic way.

00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:36.235
So this is just to have a plan, right?

00:33:36.356 --> 00:33:38.319
Yeah, so systematic is like any plan.

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:40.482
And then transect is like over time.

00:33:40.882 --> 00:33:41.964
Or like over space.

00:33:42.044 --> 00:33:42.845
We use the elephant.

00:33:42.865 --> 00:33:44.247
We use the elephant.

00:33:44.488 --> 00:33:46.671
And then we did like in

00:33:53.148 --> 00:34:00.338
All right, so now go ahead and flip your paper, but try not to look at the adjoining page.

00:34:00.679 --> 00:34:01.460
I know that's silly.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:08.049
So just try and flip it and look at this one right here, where it says third, fourth, fifth.

00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:09.451
Don't look at the adjoining page.

00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:12.676
It's just there for the next step.

00:34:12.696 --> 00:34:14.238
So now third, fourth, fifth.

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:22.750
And once again, we're doing this with our students, so just kind of think about a methodology for third.

00:34:31.437 --> 00:34:34.943
And then fifth, draw a visual of what this might look like when we go outside.

00:34:34.963 --> 00:34:37.306
That's a lot to ask for just a couple minutes.

00:34:37.607 --> 00:34:40.191
Apparently, I give my students quite some time to work through this.

00:34:40.692 --> 00:34:44.958
So why don't you pick one of those three, whichever one you prefer.

00:34:45.018 --> 00:34:53.732
So either write out a methodology or what kind of preconceived ideas might you have, or draw out a visual, kind of whatever you're feeling with your brain.

00:35:04.613 --> 00:35:05.899
This is non motile, yeah?

00:36:19.758 --> 00:36:48.651
But we're doing non-modal.

00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:49.902
No snails.

00:36:52.469 --> 00:36:53.051
No snails.

00:36:59.708 --> 00:36:59.909
No snails.

00:36:59.929 --> 00:37:02.716
So plants and fungi.

00:37:02.736 --> 00:37:04.581
Or are we just doing plants?

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:45.975
All right.

00:37:52.908 --> 00:37:54.448
And then go ahead and.

00:38:01.919 --> 00:38:07.606
All right, so as we look at this criteria, this is exactly what we do.

00:38:07.647 --> 00:38:21.585
So the goal of this is that if someone were to get your data and go back to this exact same coordinate and look at this exact same spot, they could assess the biodiversity year after year and compare that to other places, right?

00:38:21.605 --> 00:38:24.028
So you could just name your quadrat anything you want.

00:38:24.088 --> 00:38:25.110
You're going to have coordinates.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.652
You're going to have the bearing using a compass.

00:38:26.992 --> 00:38:28.534
Any visual references?

00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:28.894
see?

00:38:28.975 --> 00:38:30.416
Are you this far from this pole?

00:38:30.516 --> 00:38:31.858
Are you this far from this tree?

00:38:32.819 --> 00:38:34.661
Date, time, and weather conditions.

00:38:34.681 --> 00:38:36.223
A sketch of the map of the site.

00:38:36.643 --> 00:38:37.705
Pictures of each species.

00:38:37.725 --> 00:38:40.528
So if you have a phone, you can take pictures or you can sketch pictures.

00:38:41.088 --> 00:38:51.180
We're actually, Krebs is jazzing this up a little bit at the moment, so we're gonna change it up just a little bit when we get outside and we're actually going to

00:38:51.515 --> 00:39:03.076
decide what species we see the most of, and then we're going to classify those as A through E. So we all have five species that are common, and then we're going to have other.

00:39:03.416 --> 00:39:11.090
So then we could compile our data and say, okay, the biodiversity of this quadrat had this much A, and the biodiversity of this quadrat had this much of this species.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:12.392
Does that make sense?

00:39:13.823 --> 00:39:16.288
He's going to orchestrate that because his brain's going.

00:39:16.829 --> 00:39:24.063
And then these are the things that you're going to have to have when you finish your report.

00:39:24.103 --> 00:39:26.748
So same for my students.

00:39:26.768 --> 00:39:28.331
All right, so let's keep flipping for just a second.

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:32.559
I don't think, yeah, you're good.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.942
You can go to the next one.

00:39:34.782 --> 00:39:38.285
All right, so once again, this is just stuff I show my students on Canvas.

00:39:38.886 --> 00:39:40.267
So this is from the IB website.

00:39:40.287 --> 00:39:42.029
So we took a picture of the whole area.

00:39:42.089 --> 00:39:44.551
You can see there's pictures of the typical vegetation.

00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:46.333
So just look through these few pages for a moment.

00:39:47.054 --> 00:39:49.376
You can see the site two is like in Switzerland.

00:39:49.396 --> 00:39:50.337
They've got the coordinates.

00:39:50.357 --> 00:39:51.578
They've got the altitude.

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:55.041
They've got pictures of the different species there.

00:39:55.081 --> 00:39:56.843
So we're kind of doing something similar to this.

00:39:57.603 --> 00:40:02.528
I just put those on there just to kind of give us a visual reference before we go out.

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:05.813
All right, so we are about to go outside.

00:40:06.434 --> 00:40:12.281
If you look at your objective again, so we are going to figure out, evaluate population abundance of non-modal species.

00:40:13.142 --> 00:40:14.805
What does that mean?

00:40:14.825 --> 00:40:15.405
Non-movie.

00:40:15.786 --> 00:40:17.168
We are going to estimate.

00:40:17.388 --> 00:40:18.029
Is it going to be perfect?

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:19.651
Heck no.

00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:22.975
We're going to do random, systematic, or transect.

00:40:22.995 --> 00:40:24.217
What do y'all think if we're using hula hoops?

00:40:24.517 --> 00:40:24.938
Transect.

00:40:28.124 --> 00:40:28.745
Yeah.

00:40:28.765 --> 00:40:32.311
So with my kids, when we get to the garden, sometimes they're very careful.

00:40:32.371 --> 00:40:34.995
Like, I want all the species in my hula hoop, right?

00:40:35.276 --> 00:40:37.880
But then other times, they're like, woo!

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.202
And see where it lands.

00:40:39.222 --> 00:40:42.568
So when I first started doing this, it was in January.

00:40:42.788 --> 00:40:47.696
We were outside, and we were just assessing the biodiversity of what's in the grass, really.

00:40:47.977 --> 00:40:50.801
And now we have a native garden, so we can use it a little bit more for that and stuff.

00:40:50.821 --> 00:40:52.624
So yeah.

00:40:52.644 --> 00:40:54.267
So quadrants are not systematic.

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:56.394
They can be.

00:40:56.414 --> 00:40:57.174
They can be.

00:40:57.295 --> 00:40:58.376
But ours are not going to be.

00:40:58.396 --> 00:40:58.816
They will not.

00:40:58.836 --> 00:40:59.417
OK.

00:40:59.717 --> 00:41:00.158
Got it.

00:41:00.178 --> 00:41:00.919
I've got the difference.

00:41:01.719 --> 00:41:01.820
OK.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.201
So you need your journal.

00:41:04.122 --> 00:41:05.323
You need a partner.

00:41:09.408 --> 00:41:10.389
Probably a clipboard.

00:41:10.449 --> 00:41:12.411
Obviously, your packet, right?

00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:14.473
So you can know what criteria is included.

00:41:14.493 --> 00:41:19.539
There are also two examples of what my students have done in the past.

00:41:19.559 --> 00:41:22.482
There was one from home and then one from school.

00:41:26.393 --> 00:41:29.798
I think what we can do now is I left the hula hoops outside.

00:41:30.118 --> 00:41:32.942
We're not using quadrants, I think you mentioned that.

00:41:32.962 --> 00:41:36.447
Grab a partner, grab a hula hoop, and I'll give you further instructions.

00:41:36.687 --> 00:41:38.970
We're going to kind of go where moth and bat less.

00:41:41.033 --> 00:41:43.056
And bear poop.

00:41:43.076 --> 00:41:43.777
Yeah, close your eyes.

00:41:43.797 --> 00:41:44.858
We'll play moth and bat.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:48.483
I'll play the moth.

00:41:49.605 --> 00:41:52.108
Find me.

00:41:52.148 --> 00:41:55.793
You got tape and marker.

00:42:54.194 --> 00:43:03.361
That's just the IB stuff.

00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:06.631
There's all, you know, all international.

00:43:07.233 --> 00:43:12.709
That's true.
