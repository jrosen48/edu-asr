1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:25,673
[SPEAKER_03] And as you likely already know, salamanders are very sensitive organisms.

2
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,255
[SPEAKER_03] One of the reasons they're so sensitive is because they don't breathe through internal lungs in the same way that we mammals do.

3
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,456
[SPEAKER_03] They perform gas exchange through the medium of their skin.

4
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:30,257
[SPEAKER_03] Every part of the salamander is

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:57,001
[SPEAKER_03] opportunity, and so it's really important for us to make sure that we are not contaminating the salamander skin with any of the oils or contaminants on our skin, which could be hand sanitizer or soap or a little bit of salt from the snack you just ate.

6
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:57,662
[SPEAKER_03] We are going to instead use this

7
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:23,456
[SPEAKER_03] is going to be flipping up the rocks, and who's going to be holding the bag?

8
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,179
[SPEAKER_03] Of course, you can keep rotating those rolls as well.

9
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,885
[SPEAKER_03] So John, would you like to lift this black rock here?

10
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:29,005
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

11
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:38,782
[SPEAKER_04] If we are getting ready to lift the rock, we want to have our bag down low, ready to press against the ground, so if there's something under there, it doesn't run under the bag.

12
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:39,002
[SPEAKER_03] You ready?

13
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:39,783
[SPEAKER_05] Ready.

14
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,125
[SPEAKER_03] OK.

15
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,207
[SPEAKER_03] Oh, look.

16
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:43,229
[SPEAKER_03] Oh!

17
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:43,950
[SPEAKER_04] We actually got it.

18
00:01:48,824 --> 00:02:07,272
[SPEAKER_03] orange china gecko um that's what's printed on the bottom of this guy underneath we're gonna put down our bag and then using something soft like a little leaf or something we can tickle the tail of our little friend and get it to run into our bags yes we got it seldom happens

19
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,014
[SPEAKER_03] that easily.

20
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:14,668
[SPEAKER_03] A lot of them are going to get away because they're small and they're fast and they're brown and you lose track of them.

21
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:24,690
[SPEAKER_03] If there had been nothing under our rock we would simply put the rock back gently in the same place that it was not like flinging it through the creek to hit someone else.

22
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,235
[SPEAKER_03] But because we have our salamander in the back

23
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:30,142
[SPEAKER_03] We're going to make sure that it's got a little bit of water.

24
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:43,678
[SPEAKER_03] I like to say maybe a fingernail worth of water in that bag with our salamander so it can stay moist and slimy for optimum gas exchange.

25
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,661
[SPEAKER_03] Zip this bag back up.

26
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:50,767
[SPEAKER_03] Don't have to worry about it because we've got oxygen from the bag as well as from the water.

27
00:02:50,787 --> 00:02:54,792
[SPEAKER_03] And then we're going to bring this number one bag, salamander and water intact, back to our base.

28
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:17,122
[SPEAKER_03] zipped into its bag inside and exchange it for the number one cone, which is going to be placed in the same spot we found our salmon.

29
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:24,171
[SPEAKER_03] That way we're later able to collect data from that spot knowing that it was a spot that apparently is preferred by salmon.

30
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:36,183
[SPEAKER_03] Some rules about our salamander survey are that only one salamander can ever go in that bag.

31
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:42,629
[SPEAKER_03] So even if you find it next to three of its siblings, only one gets to go inside the bag.

32
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,913
[SPEAKER_03] The bag is only used for one salamander.

33
00:03:45,933 --> 00:03:50,698
[SPEAKER_03] So if you have a salamander captured in your bag, you cannot dump them out and be like, no, I'm going for a bigger one.

34
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:14,970
[SPEAKER_03] Additionally, recommend that you not flip rocks that are bigger than your own head.

35
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,632
[SPEAKER_03] And just be a little bit careful of your feet as you're moving through the stream.

36
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,216
[SPEAKER_03] Sometimes we have a habit of jumping rock to rock, but since we know those rocks are also places salamanders prefer to be under,

37
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:49,223
[SPEAKER_03] We're going to establish some simple boundaries that will be from these fallen logs across the stream.

38
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:51,027
[SPEAKER_03] All the way up to here, the left fork of the stream begins in the bank and an approximate

39
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:18,634
[SPEAKER_03] minutes for this search if you have questions about your salamanders we might ask you to hold on to them but certainly if you have a salamander in the bag and you'd like to share it with

40
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:42,428
[SPEAKER_08] that when you're flipping rocks to flip them away from you and not towards you, why might that be a piece of advice?

41
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:56,012
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah, one when we set it back down and second, salamanders are not the only friends that live under rocks, so if you flip a rock and there is a snake or another critter that maybe you are less excited to see,

42
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,946
[SPEAKER_03] Yes.

43
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:12,427
[SPEAKER_03] Two people per bag.

44
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,694
[SPEAKER_03] That just means that we're not going to catch 18,000.

45
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,418
[SPEAKER_03] We're going to limit the number that we're going to catch.

46
00:06:17,438 --> 00:06:19,343
[SPEAKER_03] Just a bag for now.

47
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:23,552
[SPEAKER_03] We won't give you the cone until you come back with your bag, but you need a bag and a partner for now.

48
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,196
[SPEAKER_06] Never caught.

49
00:06:42,456 --> 00:06:43,558
[SPEAKER_06] Well, either one.

50
00:06:43,578 --> 00:06:45,020
[SPEAKER_06] Either one of those things.

51
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,781
[SPEAKER_06] Just curious.

52
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:46,442
[SPEAKER_06] Not caught.

53
00:06:46,462 --> 00:06:48,405
[SPEAKER_06] Yeah, I mean, this is a really cool thing.

54
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:51,550
[SPEAKER_06] We do it a lot, so for us it's like, oh, we're going to go get salamanders.

55
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,631
[SPEAKER_06] But it's exciting.

56
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:56,837
[SPEAKER_06] I guess it's not something you do every day, obviously, and it's just really fun.

57
00:06:57,058 --> 00:06:59,381
[SPEAKER_06] Just take the time to just enjoy.

58
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,623
[SPEAKER_06] They're smaller than you think.

59
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:03,327
[SPEAKER_06] I mean, we might find adult salamanders that are that big.

60
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:45,952
[SPEAKER_03] Not all salamanders are aquatic, though, so we have terrestrial salamanders.

61
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:48,995
[SPEAKER_03] They are often found in places that stay really wet, so the high elevations where it's misty all the time is a great place for terrestrial salamanders.

62
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,357
[SPEAKER_03] All over the park is phenomenal compared to the rest of the world.

63
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,538
[SPEAKER_03] This is the salamander capital of the world.

64
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:51,799
[SPEAKER_03] Thirty-one.

65
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:52,700
[SPEAKER_03] Now we know.

66
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,040
[SPEAKER_03] Grab a buddy.

67
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:12,717
[SPEAKER_05] So if you're ready to be on camera I can be whatever.

68
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:45,506
[SPEAKER_05] Thank you.

69
00:09:55,516 --> 00:09:58,337
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

70
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:58,834
[SPEAKER_05] I didn't see any better.

71
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:16,855
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

72
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:16,975
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

73
00:11:49,928 --> 00:12:19,007
[SPEAKER_03] We don't get another bag.

74
00:12:37,938 --> 00:13:02,646
[SPEAKER_05] I'm the only one.

75
00:13:06,997 --> 00:13:16,348
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

76
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:56,545
[SPEAKER_03] On a day like today when it's just rain.

77
00:14:58,338 --> 00:15:22,040
[SPEAKER_05] Who did not get their number?

78
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,561
[SPEAKER_05] That's not my salamander.

79
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:23,282
[SPEAKER_05] We got one with a little bit there.

80
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:38,740
[SPEAKER_03] I think I was three.

81
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:52,543
[SPEAKER_03] Oh my goodness, look how small he is.

82
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:18,634
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

83
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:30,647
[SPEAKER_02] Mars is number seven.

84
00:16:39,773 --> 00:17:09,578
[SPEAKER_05] the one they just found.

85
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:38,518
[SPEAKER_05] I saw this.

86
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,727
[SPEAKER_03] We got one.

87
00:17:57,747 --> 00:17:59,369
[SPEAKER_03] I'm just glad we found one.

88
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:03,134
[SPEAKER_03] That's a good idea.

89
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:06,519
[SPEAKER_03] Sell and face it with salamanders.

90
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,223
[SPEAKER_03] But when we do the snail survey, I'll be the only one that didn't find a snail.

91
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:14,149
[SPEAKER_03] And it's like, you feel like you're four years old.

92
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:17,253
[SPEAKER_03] And people are like, oh, you can buy a snail.

93
00:18:17,273 --> 00:18:18,214
[SPEAKER_03] I want to do it myself.

94
00:18:18,234 --> 00:18:21,659
[SPEAKER_05] You might need a tiny bit more water.

95
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,680
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah, he's cute.

96
00:18:39,839 --> 00:19:00,835
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah, that looks great.

97
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:35,260
[SPEAKER_05] We're going to be looking at all these a little bit closer.

98
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:27,855
[SPEAKER_00] Sometimes I'm just like I'm talking like extra loud, but we're coming like around there.

99
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,753
[SPEAKER_03] Just make sure like alright, so we're coming over here.

100
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:58,622
[SPEAKER_05] Good.

101
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:35,647
[SPEAKER_07] Is that the seven?

102
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:37,009
[SPEAKER_07] That was ours.

103
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,051
[SPEAKER_07] Yeah, we tried to get some more in there.

104
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:39,933
[SPEAKER_07] He's in there.

105
00:21:42,536 --> 00:22:01,482
[SPEAKER_03] Very well camouflaged.

106
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:31,091
[SPEAKER_03] Especially if you've got an itty bitty branch, recommend it.

107
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:33,274
And if you've got a really muddy bag, you can swap it out for, I think I caught eight, so eight is the word.

108
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,681
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah.

109
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:53,052
[SPEAKER_05] No.

110
00:23:29,988 --> 00:23:31,170
[SPEAKER_06] Okay.

111
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:33,894
[SPEAKER_06] I see some additional details.

112
00:23:33,915 --> 00:23:39,003
[SPEAKER_06] If you want to open the bag and look at him from above without the bag, that can really help see the clarity.

113
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:47,277
[SPEAKER_06] I'll try getting a little extra light on him.

114
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:50,722
[SPEAKER_06] So you can see a couple of details right there.

115
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:53,146
[SPEAKER_06] Like what's the main thing you see from on top?

116
00:23:53,507 --> 00:23:54,088
[SPEAKER_06] Yeah.

117
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:29,627
[SPEAKER_06] Up between his front legs Yeah

118
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:31,707
[SPEAKER_06] Oh wow.

119
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:59,901
[SPEAKER_06] Look at that.

120
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:12,637
[SPEAKER_06] And if you look very closely behind his eyes, and you usually have to look from above, you may see some of the little gills, looks like little fingers coming from the side of his head.

121
00:25:12,657 --> 00:25:15,561
[SPEAKER_06] And they look a little pinkish to me, a little reddish.

122
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:18,746
[SPEAKER_07] Almost like those, like, oxalotl-like.

123
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:20,509
[SPEAKER_06] Yeah, it is the same.

124
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:26,057
[SPEAKER_06] I caught you a new friend.

125
00:25:26,678 --> 00:25:32,310
[SPEAKER_06] So yeah, see if you can do a little sketching of that, maybe even from a couple different perspectives.

126
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,034
[SPEAKER_02] I'm going to grab my paper.

127
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,678
[SPEAKER_02] I'll be right back.

128
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:38,404
[SPEAKER_02] Let me grab my paper.

129
00:25:39,627 --> 00:25:44,417
[SPEAKER_06] I could clear that water up for you.

130
00:25:53,105 --> 00:26:09,431
[SPEAKER_03] If you're stuck for things to notice, as you are preserving your salamander, there's a place out there.

131
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:13,177
[SPEAKER_03] Does it have spots?

132
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:13,377
[SPEAKER_03] How many?

133
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:13,617
[SPEAKER_03] What shade?

134
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:14,218
[SPEAKER_03] What do their eyes look like?

135
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:16,682
[SPEAKER_03] And try not to hold the salamander right on your palm, because we have such hot skin.

136
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:30,368
[SPEAKER_04] you're like he's

137
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,859
[SPEAKER_05] you

138
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:52,129
[SPEAKER_02] This is what I just got.

139
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,232
[SPEAKER_02] This one.

140
00:27:54,332 --> 00:28:08,817
[SPEAKER_02] A tail and two pictures.

141
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:23,920
[SPEAKER_05] That's a good-looking salamander

142
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,792
[SPEAKER_06] semi, you know, translucent bellies.

143
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:51,317
[SPEAKER_06] You can see here those white, see that white line of spots right along the side?

144
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:53,660
[SPEAKER_06] Turn it, turn it, can you pick this out?

145
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,984
[SPEAKER_06] It's like a, if you look at it right on the side.

146
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:04,892
[SPEAKER_04] And if you're feeling like maybe you are, you stood up too fast.

147
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:09,617
[SPEAKER_04] If you are feeling like you are reaching the end of your drawing,

148
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:12,440
[SPEAKER_07] It's gonna be Inception.

149
00:29:13,021 --> 00:29:14,282
[SPEAKER_04] There's Camception.

150
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:20,810
[SPEAKER_02] As they say, I'm the Fed.

151
00:29:23,272 --> 00:29:25,955
[SPEAKER_08] This is gonna be weird.

152
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:35,727
[SPEAKER_07] I'm not used to doing one of these.

153
00:29:35,747 --> 00:29:38,029
[SPEAKER_07] Camera show.

154
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,291
[SPEAKER_07] We're moving on.

155
00:29:40,152 --> 00:29:41,173
[SPEAKER_07] We're moving on.

156
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:08,279
[SPEAKER_02] Do you think he has black tits on his toes or that his toes are the same color as... They look... I think they look the same.

157
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:09,942
[SPEAKER_02] Same color as the rest of toe and foot.

158
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,063
[SPEAKER_02] I think so too.

159
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:11,183
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah.

160
00:30:11,203 --> 00:30:11,925
[SPEAKER_02] Okay, go to seven.

161
00:30:11,945 --> 00:30:14,188
[SPEAKER_02] Do you think he has a rounded snout?

162
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:22,079
[SPEAKER_02] Gills are like fingers rather than feathery plumes and are white or pale, not reddish.

163
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,361
[SPEAKER_02] Or...

164
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,713
[SPEAKER_02] You can have a snout with corners.

165
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:28,116
[SPEAKER_02] Gills like feathery coins.

166
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:29,559
[SPEAKER_07] I don't think it looks like corners.

167
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:31,421
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah.

168
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,743
[SPEAKER_02] Looks like rounded, right?

169
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,227
[SPEAKER_05] Yeah, I think so too.

170
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:38,252
[SPEAKER_02] Unidentified dusky salamander.

171
00:30:38,752 --> 00:30:40,615
[SPEAKER_02] Let's look and see here.

172
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:45,222
[SPEAKER_07] There's also the, what's that, juvenile or what is it, larval?

173
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,043
[SPEAKER_07] That.

174
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:47,105
[SPEAKER_02] It does look more like that.

175
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,868
[SPEAKER_02] Cornered, yeah.

176
00:30:48,968 --> 00:30:51,091
[SPEAKER_02] I'm glad they have a picture of round versus cornered.

177
00:30:51,512 --> 00:30:52,153
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that's good.

178
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:52,453
[SPEAKER_02] Okay, so then.

179
00:30:52,923 --> 00:31:18,441
[SPEAKER_02] usually shorter than 35 millimeters pairs of white spots down back now usually longer than 35 millimeters he was about that long gill's very red pores on face hard to see that i think again because it's small maybe he's a blue ridge two line salamander

180
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:53,743
[SPEAKER_07] Do you see I think they're down yeah, I think it's stripe the things below the stripes so maybe he's a Blue Ridge to live He could be whatever he wants

181
00:31:54,803 --> 00:32:00,352
[SPEAKER_04] So one thing that we can look at is we have a different key for larva than adults.

182
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:01,934
[SPEAKER_04] Yes, we were looking down here.

183
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:09,566
[SPEAKER_04] And the gill shape is illustrated a little bit better on the back of whether we've got needles or feathers.

184
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:11,749
[SPEAKER_04] I don't think it's feathers.

185
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:16,345
[SPEAKER_04] That's really hard to see.

186
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:24,735
[SPEAKER_04] I think if we got a hand lens, it'd be more feather bows than punk rock spikes.

187
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:27,859
[SPEAKER_04] Right here, we're keying out a teeny tiny one.

188
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,523
[SPEAKER_04] He's right about 35.

189
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:35,307
[SPEAKER_02] Solid work.

190
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,055
[SPEAKER_03] Does he still have gills?

191
00:32:39,075 --> 00:32:39,275
[SPEAKER_04] Yeah.

192
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:40,577
[SPEAKER_04] Very cool.

193
00:32:40,597 --> 00:32:43,921
[SPEAKER_04] And they're like feather boa gills.

194
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,543
[SPEAKER_04] So the other one is much bigger.

195
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:53,173
[SPEAKER_04] So size is not necessarily a determinant for larva.

196
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:56,377
[SPEAKER_04] I have seen adults smaller than that.

197
00:32:56,898 --> 00:33:03,927
[SPEAKER_02] So we're here at a pairs of white spots down back or gills very red horizontal face.

198
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:09,359
[SPEAKER_04] There you go.

199
00:33:09,739 --> 00:33:34,842
[SPEAKER_02] Crushing it.

200
00:33:36,172 --> 00:33:57,927
[SPEAKER_03] Then you as your buddy may say farewell to your salamander.

201
00:33:57,947 --> 00:33:59,270
[SPEAKER_03] Now to release your salamander you're going to take it back to it.

202
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,592
[SPEAKER_03] I want to make sure you hear this first even if you're not ready.

203
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:00,812
[SPEAKER_03] Bless you.

204
00:34:06,935 --> 00:34:28,226
[SPEAKER_03] And I'm going to take my salamander back.

205
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:28,967
I'm going to kneel down by the cone.

206
00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:30,208
[SPEAKER_05] And I'm going to gently take my first bag and take my second.

207
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:32,092
[SPEAKER_03] I am not going to take up the rock paper and replace the salamander and the rock back on top.

208
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:32,351
[SPEAKER_03] Fair enough.

209
00:34:37,782 --> 00:35:01,539
[SPEAKER_03] Then you can double check that bag before you bring that back.

210
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,982
[SPEAKER_03] You're going to leave the cone in place, so don't put the bag in place.

211
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:03,462
[SPEAKER_03] Keep the cone in place.

212
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:03,823
[SPEAKER_03] And so that's it.

213
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:14,083
[SPEAKER_05] You ready?
