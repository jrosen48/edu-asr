1
00:00:07,523 --> 00:00:27,629
[SPEAKER_01] Do you mind if we record your own conversation Okay, no, that's totally fine.

2
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:36,501
[SPEAKER_02] Thank you

3
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:59,991
[SPEAKER_02] Okay, so I got a single leaf what we call simple leaf so that's one category.

4
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:00,800
[SPEAKER_02] I guess.

5
00:01:01,982 --> 00:01:08,193
[SPEAKER_02] And this one is a compound leaf because it is many leaflets in one leaf.

6
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:13,022
[SPEAKER_02] So I'm going to say we got one compound is what I'm going to say.

7
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:14,745
[SPEAKER_02] That's category.

8
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:22,840
[SPEAKER_02] What else could we find?

9
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,089
[SPEAKER_02] We could see if any of the trees are fruiting, so they maybe have seeds.

10
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,632
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

11
00:01:31,672 --> 00:01:33,054
[SPEAKER_02] That would be another category.

12
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:35,418
[SPEAKER_00] We can do that.

13
00:01:37,482 --> 00:01:38,804
[SPEAKER_02] You go a direction, too.

14
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:40,207
[SPEAKER_02] I don't know if I'm doing this right.

15
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,852
[SPEAKER_00] Well, that's not a red leaf.

16
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:43,553
[SPEAKER_00] Is that a red leaf?

17
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:44,414
[SPEAKER_00] No.

18
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:45,857
[SPEAKER_02] I don't know.

19
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:46,218
[SPEAKER_02] Is it?

20
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:47,340
[SPEAKER_02] That's a fungus.

21
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,642
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah, let's not do that.

22
00:01:49,432 --> 00:01:57,700
[SPEAKER_00] It would be I mean we could write it down write it down.

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:03,746
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah fungus leaf or fungus fungi mushroom.

24
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:12,754
[SPEAKER_02] Here's another compound leaf, but this one's different because it's got multiple leaflets on different locations.

25
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:13,635
[SPEAKER_00] Yes.

26
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,738
[SPEAKER_02] So I don't know how you want to do that.

27
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:23,196
[SPEAKER_02] So the one this one is a compound, but it stems from a single point where this one stems from different points.

28
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:23,957
[SPEAKER_00] All right.

29
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,519
[SPEAKER_02] So I'm just going to draw a picture.

30
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,100
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

31
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:29,545
[SPEAKER_00] Single point versus multi point.

32
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:30,366
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

33
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:43,165
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, looks good to me.

34
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,209
[SPEAKER_02] OK.

35
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,452
[SPEAKER_02] Don't touch the poison ivy.

36
00:02:51,876 --> 00:02:52,398
[SPEAKER_00] So let's see.

37
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:53,401
[SPEAKER_02] What else we got?

38
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:53,882
[SPEAKER_02] Let's see.

39
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:01,845
[SPEAKER_00] I don't know.

40
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:05,958
[SPEAKER_00] These are similar leaves we already saw or aren't.

41
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,821
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, they're just shapes different.

42
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:15,856
[SPEAKER_02] These are simple leaves because there's the bud right there, but they're just bigger and shape more heart shape.

43
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:18,400
[SPEAKER_02] You could do shapes of leaves.

44
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:19,783
[SPEAKER_02] Another category, I guess.

45
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,631
[SPEAKER_00] What heart shapes?

46
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:23,354
[SPEAKER_02] Shapes of leaves, I guess.

47
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:24,095
[SPEAKER_02] I don't know.

48
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:25,497
[SPEAKER_00] Shapes.

49
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:29,103
[SPEAKER_02] Because that one's more heart shaped than this simple leaf was.

50
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:30,265
[SPEAKER_02] So the shapes of leaves.

51
00:03:30,565 --> 00:03:31,066
[SPEAKER_02] OK.

52
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,929
[SPEAKER_02] Compound versus simple versus shape.

53
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,851
[SPEAKER_02] This one's like a star shape.

54
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,253
[SPEAKER_02] I guess I could draw one like that.

55
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,374
[SPEAKER_00] So you're artist?

56
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:55,035
[SPEAKER_02] No.

57
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:56,638
[SPEAKER_02] By no means.

58
00:03:57,018 --> 00:03:59,321
[SPEAKER_02] I'm just drawing.

59
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,586
[SPEAKER_02] Squiggles is what I'm drawing.

60
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:03,527
[SPEAKER_00] Well, I'll let you have that.

61
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:07,353
[SPEAKER_00] Let's see.

62
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:07,954
[SPEAKER_00] What else?

63
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:13,181
[SPEAKER_00] What other leaves are there?

64
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:14,523
[SPEAKER_02] There's needle leaves.

65
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:17,166
[SPEAKER_02] You could do needles like the.

66
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:17,708
[SPEAKER_00] These right here?

67
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,310
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah.

68
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:20,652
[SPEAKER_02] That's a different category.

69
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,978
[SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna pull a little piece off there.

70
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:31,465
[SPEAKER_02] Needle leaves.

71
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,492
[SPEAKER_02] Broadleaf, needle leaf.

72
00:04:43,057 --> 00:04:49,863
[SPEAKER_02] These are single, these are kinda like the single leaves where they're only like they're connected at one point.

73
00:04:50,044 --> 00:04:50,484
[SPEAKER_00] One point?

74
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,465
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

75
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,109
[SPEAKER_00] So go in that category.

76
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:05,640
[SPEAKER_02] Pines have different needles.

77
00:05:19,272 --> 00:05:25,060
[SPEAKER_02] Show me a few spots a little different.

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,785
[SPEAKER_00] I see if I see any other leaves that haven't really been our radar.

79
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:41,462
[SPEAKER_00] I mean, yeah.

80
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:46,208
[SPEAKER_00] All these leaves are very similar in a sense.

81
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,756
[SPEAKER_00] I haven't seen anything that's like just stuck out.

82
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,099
[SPEAKER_02] Right, that's different.

83
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:04,028
[SPEAKER_02] Oh, there's a pine of some kind.

84
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,317
[SPEAKER_02] Let's see if there's anything.

85
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:22,499
[SPEAKER_02] Oh, here we go.

86
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:25,983
Oh, look a little.

87
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:26,243
Look at him.

88
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:30,067
[SPEAKER_02] Let him go, let him go, let him go.

89
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:30,607
[SPEAKER_02] Let's see.

90
00:06:30,668 --> 00:06:34,131
[SPEAKER_02] So this one's a pine, but the needle leaves are different.

91
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,673
[SPEAKER_02] Let's see if I can find a bundle.

92
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:45,203
[SPEAKER_02] Let's see.

93
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,241
[SPEAKER_02] I don't see a bundle in the ground.

94
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:08,322
[SPEAKER_02] This sucker does not drop stuff, does it?

95
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:18,195
[SPEAKER_02] Okay, I can't see.

96
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:27,147
[SPEAKER_02] This one actually looks like it has maybe three in a bundle.

97
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:36,259
[SPEAKER_02] Like each little unit, like at the base where the needles stem out.

98
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,245
[SPEAKER_02] This one looks like maybe it has three together that stem out from the same thing.

99
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:43,028
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

100
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:43,789
[SPEAKER_02] Maybe?

101
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:45,891
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

102
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:48,875
[SPEAKER_02] Because this one, this one's vastly different than those.

103
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,637
[SPEAKER_00] I just can't find one.

104
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:52,339
[SPEAKER_00] So that is more spread out, almost.

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,862
[SPEAKER_02] Right, like they're longer needles.

106
00:07:54,983 --> 00:07:59,268
[SPEAKER_00] So it's like a different category of a pine tree.

107
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:01,110
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, of a needle leaf.

108
00:08:02,152 --> 00:08:03,673
[SPEAKER_02] I can't find any, though.

109
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,557
[SPEAKER_02] Not any that are together.

110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:29,271
[SPEAKER_00] there's one right there there's three oh there's three in one two three here we go all right how much original one we had well that's the single one with all those um yeah oh what was that

111
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:37,599
[SPEAKER_00] Glad I didn't say no bad words.

112
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:38,740
[SPEAKER_00] I kept it clean.

113
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,870
[SPEAKER_02] OK.

114
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,933
[SPEAKER_01] What group were you on?

115
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:49,776
[SPEAKER_02] Categorical.

116
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,398
[SPEAKER_01] Oh, wow, that's a challenging.

117
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:54,843
[SPEAKER_01] That's, I think, the most abstract.

118
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:55,704
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, probably.

119
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:00,170
[SPEAKER_01] It's funny.

120
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,915
[SPEAKER_01] When we talked about the different terms, I remember categorical was one that

121
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:07,055
[SPEAKER_01] It's very vague.

122
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:10,885
[SPEAKER_02] It could be taken many different directions.

123
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:18,546
[SPEAKER_00] It makes you be creative and kind of like create a category based on the look.

124
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:28,842
[SPEAKER_00] As she said, single point, then you have multi-point when it came down to that with the leaves and whatnot.

125
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,849
[SPEAKER_01] I like how Annie's like, it's very subtle.

126
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:35,133
[SPEAKER_01] Like, I will raise my hand when I watch you.

127
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:39,560
[SPEAKER_01] You have to create the category.

128
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:42,285
[SPEAKER_01] It's kind of the labeling endeavor.

129
00:09:42,305 --> 00:09:42,405
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

130
00:09:42,425 --> 00:09:42,525
[SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

131
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,202
[SPEAKER_01] which in some ways the natural world resists.

132
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,706
[SPEAKER_01] Not everything falls into the same pot.

133
00:09:50,906 --> 00:09:54,530
[SPEAKER_01] Right, I mean even species, there's often a continuum between related.

134
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,893
[SPEAKER_01] It's a spectrum, it's not a linear.

135
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:08,985
[SPEAKER_01] Right.

136
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:18,625
[SPEAKER_01] I think so.

137
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,089
[SPEAKER_00] I think so.

138
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:35,197
[SPEAKER_00] categorical and we decided to do leaves.

139
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,537
[SPEAKER_00] And so we have single point, multi-point, and stuff of that sort.

140
00:10:58,612 --> 00:11:06,090
[SPEAKER_02] Oh you deserve
