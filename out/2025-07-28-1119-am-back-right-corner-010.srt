1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:01,512
[SPEAKER_12] Why did we classify this as an insect?

2
00:00:01,913 --> 00:00:02,593
[SPEAKER_12] Where's my person?

3
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,855
[SPEAKER_12] Oh, why did we classify this as an insect?

4
00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:07,077
[SPEAKER_12] It has six legs.

5
00:00:07,097 --> 00:00:09,579
[SPEAKER_12] Yep, all right, beautiful.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,200
[SPEAKER_12] Other artifacts?

7
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:13,142
[SPEAKER_12] Go ahead.

8
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:19,708
[SPEAKER_02] I have a bunch of different types of leaves, but we had categorical, so we decided to categorize different types of leaves.

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:29,616
[SPEAKER_02] So, compound leaf with several leaflets, that is just one leaf, single leaf, pine versus hemlock,

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,457
[SPEAKER_02] So bundles of needles versus single needles.

11
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,222
[SPEAKER_02] And that kind of stuff.

12
00:00:39,603 --> 00:00:39,743
[SPEAKER_05] Nice.

13
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:40,063
[SPEAKER_05] Artifacts?

14
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:40,464
[SPEAKER_05] Pictures?

15
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:41,886
[SPEAKER_05] Picture of a leaf.

16
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:43,188
[SPEAKER_05] Just identifying a tree.

17
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:43,909
[SPEAKER_05] Using my naturalist.

18
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:44,750
[SPEAKER_12] Nice.

19
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,933
[SPEAKER_05] I think it's a basswood tree.

20
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:47,674
[SPEAKER_05] Nice.

21
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,336
[SPEAKER_05] So was it just right out here?

22
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:50,177
[SPEAKER_05] Just right out there, yeah.

23
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:50,558
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah, nice.

24
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:56,632
[SPEAKER_04] We had an excellent picture of Virginia creeper versus poison ivy Side-by-side.

25
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:58,174
[SPEAKER_04] What was your species richness?

26
00:00:58,294 --> 00:01:20,562
[SPEAKER_04] Okay, so we were doing just a Survey in a 10 by 10 triangle seeing how high we could bump the species richness in a 10-minute Observation period see what you get to we got four mature species mature tree species we got probably eight to nine species of saplings and

27
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:25,707
[SPEAKER_07] We saw moss, but don't know species of moss.

28
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:28,892
[SPEAKER_07] It was green, and it was moss.

29
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:32,197
[SPEAKER_07] And then we found... Double digit ground cover.

30
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,199
[SPEAKER_07] Yeah, double digit.

31
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:41,150
[SPEAKER_07] We were at nine, we didn't know what type, but nine different species, and then add poison ivy and creeper to that, or add 11 ground cover species.

32
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:42,492
[SPEAKER_12] Nice, cool.

33
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:47,660
[SPEAKER_12] So you started categorizing those as well, so different kinds and all that?

34
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:48,721
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

35
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:49,823
[SPEAKER_12] Nice, cool.

36
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,745
[SPEAKER_12] What's your artifact?

37
00:01:52,825 --> 00:02:00,515
[SPEAKER_09] So we have fungi, and a lot of the time whenever I was going around and she was just like trying to identify them all with pictures, I was like, that's awesome.

38
00:02:00,976 --> 00:02:02,218
[SPEAKER_09] I was just like, I see a bunch of them.

39
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:10,848
[SPEAKER_09] But one of the things that I've experienced is people, and I even have a hard time whenever it's a difference between like a lichen versus fungi.

40
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,835
[SPEAKER_09] So this was just like one of the ones that I picked up that was kind of cool looking.

41
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:17,237
[SPEAKER_09] Lichen or fungi?

42
00:02:17,818 --> 00:02:18,679
[SPEAKER_12] Fungi.

43
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:20,797
[SPEAKER_12] What were you taking pictures?

44
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:21,779
[SPEAKER_12] What were you doing?

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,268
[SPEAKER_12] I'm using Google lands, and I was also just getting our data.

46
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:26,529
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

47
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,252
[SPEAKER_12] Just like different photos.

48
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:28,893
[SPEAKER_12] Yes.

49
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:29,575
[SPEAKER_12] Beautiful.

50
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:32,721
[SPEAKER_12] So then you could go back and have that information available to you.

51
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,302
[SPEAKER_12] Beautiful.

52
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:34,344
[SPEAKER_12] All right.

53
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:36,769
[SPEAKER_12] Any other artifacts or pictures anyone want to share?

54
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:43,741
[SPEAKER_12] All right.

55
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:44,501
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

56
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:44,842
[SPEAKER_12] All right.

57
00:02:44,902 --> 00:02:47,104
[SPEAKER_12] So how did it go?

58
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:48,225
[SPEAKER_12] Everything.

59
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,927
[SPEAKER_12] Were you able to find data in 10 minutes?

60
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:51,588
[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, absolutely.

61
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:51,869
[SPEAKER_02] Right.

62
00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:53,130
[SPEAKER_12] So we have time for that, right?

63
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,653
[SPEAKER_12] Can you take 10 minutes out of your time to gather data?

64
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,135
[SPEAKER_12] All right.

65
00:02:58,155 --> 00:02:59,336
[SPEAKER_12] One comment.

66
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:00,257
[SPEAKER_10] Could you say what you said?

67
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:06,283
[SPEAKER_10] I was saying it was nice to go out for 10 minutes and see how much

68
00:03:08,744 --> 00:03:12,430
[SPEAKER_10] when I think of like 10 minutes, I'm like, oh, it's not really enough time to do anything.

69
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,659
[SPEAKER_10] But we got a lot, we saw a lot of insects out there in our 10 minutes.

70
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,502
[SPEAKER_12] So that was cool.

71
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:23,388
[SPEAKER_12] So we already kind of talked about what kind of data were you able to collect, right?

72
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:23,829
[SPEAKER_12] Everyone shared.

73
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,071
[SPEAKER_12] Does anyone else want to share their data?

74
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:26,634
[SPEAKER_12] I didn't hear from this side very much.

75
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:30,921
[SPEAKER_03] We were qualitative, so we just

76
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:33,130
[SPEAKER_03] What was around us?

77
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:33,831
[SPEAKER_03] Yeah, what'd you see?

78
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:37,417
[SPEAKER_03] There's a very dense canopy color.

79
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:47,613
[SPEAKER_03] However, we had a lot of proximity to water, which helped with the large biodiversity in the area.

80
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:48,555
[SPEAKER_03] Nice.

81
00:03:48,575 --> 00:03:50,578
[SPEAKER_12] There's a lot of carbon cycle going on.

82
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:50,778
[SPEAKER_12] Nice.

83
00:03:50,838 --> 00:03:51,920
[SPEAKER_12] I like the carbon cycle.

84
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,983
[SPEAKER_12] You also mentioned water, so we're making those connections.

85
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:54,705
[SPEAKER_12] I like it.

86
00:03:54,725 --> 00:03:54,985
Cool.

87
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:56,724
[SPEAKER_12] Any challenges?

88
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:58,346
[SPEAKER_12] We didn't have a question.

89
00:03:58,867 --> 00:03:59,708
[SPEAKER_03] You wanted a question.

90
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,530
[SPEAKER_03] It would have been helpful to have a question.

91
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:01,891
[SPEAKER_03] I gotcha.

92
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:02,832
[SPEAKER_03] Like what?

93
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:05,015
[SPEAKER_03] Any question to answer.

94
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:06,137
[SPEAKER_03] Okay, gotcha.

95
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:06,517
[SPEAKER_03] Anyone.

96
00:04:07,058 --> 00:04:11,444
[SPEAKER_11] Instead of just a word response, like, oh, I know what I'm looking for instead of just like coming out.

97
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:13,126
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah, and yours was kind of vague too.

98
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:18,053
[SPEAKER_03] Yeah, well it's in relation to

99
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:19,314
[SPEAKER_12] What right?

100
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:27,904
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah, and so some of the things were more specific that you guys kind of get a more general one So yeah, yeah, I feel that for sure But yeah, like a prompt or something to go with it.

101
00:04:27,924 --> 00:04:28,485
[SPEAKER_12] That's a good idea.

102
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:29,546
[SPEAKER_12] I like that cool.

103
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,388
[SPEAKER_12] All right, anyone else?

104
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,791
[SPEAKER_06] Well, just setting parameters, right?

105
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:37,395
[SPEAKER_06] Scientific data should have some sort of repeatable parameters.

106
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:38,797
[SPEAKER_06] Okay, how big of a space?

107
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:41,560
[SPEAKER_06] Yeah, or what like we had species

108
00:04:45,995 --> 00:05:04,662
[SPEAKER_07] totally those sort of things like those are the parameters the decisions that would have to be made beforehand right yeah absolutely to me this wasn't a challenge this was the beauty of working with someone else we isolated an area and then he immediately was it started counting off steps and was able to find a

109
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:07,262
[SPEAKER_07] like the actual area, the space.

110
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:10,066
[SPEAKER_07] And I wouldn't have thought to do that.

111
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,149
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah, so having different brains, I love that.

112
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:12,389
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

113
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,961
[SPEAKER_07] So just having someone else to throw that off of, I think actually eliminates challenges, if that makes sense.

114
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:20,261
[SPEAKER_12] Absolutely.

115
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:20,521
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

116
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:20,982
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

117
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,825
[SPEAKER_12] So you'll have another brain, someone to talk to.

118
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:23,206
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah.

119
00:05:23,226 --> 00:05:24,728
[SPEAKER_12] So that's what we kind of talked about too.

120
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:25,329
[SPEAKER_10] Go ahead.

121
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:25,729
[SPEAKER_10] Yeah.

122
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,315
[SPEAKER_10] And I also liked the openness that it just said in text.

123
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:32,860
[SPEAKER_10] And so it was more about like going out and

124
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,998
[SPEAKER_10] It made me explore a lot wider area of things and then I could come up with some questions.

125
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:46,340
[SPEAKER_10] that I wouldn't have found if I had a more specific prompt.

126
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:46,940
[SPEAKER_12] Agreed.

127
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,344
[SPEAKER_12] And I think that's where we come back to like different ages and stuff too, right?

128
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:54,069
[SPEAKER_12] So you're gonna talk about a little bit of the scaffolding and stuff like that in just a second.

129
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:00,696
[SPEAKER_12] So like with high schoolers, like you can probably just give them a prompt and let their brains do their brain things, right?

130
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:06,223
[SPEAKER_12] But then with middle school and other younger babies, they might need more scaffolding and that's okay.

131
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:07,784
[SPEAKER_12] That's what we all know our babies, right?

132
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:08,966
[SPEAKER_12] Part of it.

133
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,048
[SPEAKER_12] All right, I think I might be done.

134
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:21,627
[SPEAKER_11] So this is an example of how we would use an activity like this in the middle school classroom.

135
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:24,391
[SPEAKER_11] Jen and I have both done this activity this year.

136
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:30,039
[SPEAKER_11] It's focusing on the question of how do you know if you have a healthy ecosystem or not.

137
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,843
[SPEAKER_11] And so we would do something really similar to what y'all just did.

138
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:34,605
[SPEAKER_11] We would take the iNaturalist app.

139
00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:49,530
[SPEAKER_11] on our phones, or we have class sets of iPads to have the students share those, go outside, and just capture as many examples of biotic living things in the school yard as they could in a short amount of time within 15 minutes.

140
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:58,686
[SPEAKER_11] There is a certain level of time that goes into cleaning the data so that it looks nice like this, and then it

141
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:03,183
[SPEAKER_11] would be a really simple activity with the middle school level.

142
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,667
[SPEAKER_11] Like I said, I teach 11 and 12-year-olds.

143
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:09,352
[SPEAKER_11] So when we're talking about graphing, it's very simple.

144
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:12,797
[SPEAKER_11] It's very two column bar graph.

145
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:21,349
[SPEAKER_11] We would give the students this list of species and give each student one or two different

146
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:30,333
[SPEAKER_11] data points so that they could then go and look and say is this native or is this invasive and then you could either do it on the computer.

147
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:38,023
[SPEAKER_11] We use Google Sheets and I've been really impressed with how even my 11 and 12 year olds can learn to use Google Sheets in the classroom.

148
00:07:38,763 --> 00:07:44,130
[SPEAKER_11] We use Kodak to make this graph on the bottom left and just compare if we have

149
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:54,795
[SPEAKER_11] a really big invasive bar and a really tiny native bar, how could that help us answer the question of is this a healthy ecosystem or not?

150
00:07:55,788 --> 00:07:58,513
[SPEAKER_12] I like, Audrey, that you have to just make the sticky notes.

151
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,875
[SPEAKER_11] Yeah, so this is Jen's.

152
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,778
[SPEAKER_08] Jen, you want to talk about your sticky notes?

153
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:02,620
[SPEAKER_12] Yes.

154
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:12,778
[SPEAKER_08] So I had, very similar to what Audrey said, I had each kid pick, well, I had one class do native and one class do invasive.

155
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:17,526
[SPEAKER_08] And then I had to research the species that I gave them.

156
00:08:17,995 --> 00:08:20,320
[SPEAKER_08] and had to get some certain information about it.

157
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,048
[SPEAKER_08] So each of the cards is the kind of like the little mini research that they had done.

158
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:26,092
[SPEAKER_08] I have them at the end of the day.

159
00:08:26,192 --> 00:08:27,515
[SPEAKER_08] It's like an enrichment class.

160
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:31,543
[SPEAKER_08] So like what Audrey can do and what I can do are a little bit different.

161
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,726
[SPEAKER_08] She has them earlier in the day.

162
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:38,097
[SPEAKER_08] But this was very interactive and it was a really good visual.

163
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:40,919
[SPEAKER_08] Because I think immediately they think everything is invasive.

164
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,485
[SPEAKER_08] Once they've learned those concepts, they think everything outside is not good.

165
00:08:46,205 --> 00:08:47,927
[SPEAKER_08] They think it's trashy and horrible.

166
00:08:47,947 --> 00:08:51,911
[SPEAKER_08] But based on the data, it's not really like that.

167
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,974
[SPEAKER_08] And once they look at the data, they're like, oh, wait a minute.

168
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:57,617
[SPEAKER_08] We actually do have quite a lot of native species on campus.

169
00:08:57,918 --> 00:09:00,360
[SPEAKER_03] I'm surprised by how little invasives you have.

170
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,082
[SPEAKER_08] Well, here's the thing, though.

171
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:03,403
[SPEAKER_08] We might not have a lot.

172
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:07,147
[SPEAKER_08] There's more diversity.

173
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:07,948
[SPEAKER_08] Yes.

174
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:12,033
[SPEAKER_08] But then we have a bunch of privet and a bunch of grass.

175
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:15,096
[SPEAKER_08] English ivy.

176
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,979
[SPEAKER_08] And we're going to go more into this.

177
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:22,845
[SPEAKER_08] But looking at data bias, it depends on what the kids are interested in.

178
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,827
[SPEAKER_08] Because this is from iNaturalist data.

179
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:27,570
[SPEAKER_08] So what are they interested in snapping photos of?

180
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,133
[SPEAKER_08] It's usually the thing that stands out the most.

181
00:09:30,574 --> 00:09:33,217
[SPEAKER_08] But grass, they don't tend to take pictures of, right?

182
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:37,041
[SPEAKER_11] We talked about that a lot, actually.

183
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:47,319
[SPEAKER_11] When they get to middle school, there's a really steep learning curve of them thinking that animals are alive, but not knowing that grass is alive.

184
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:54,632
[SPEAKER_11] Not knowing that grass is something that you could collect data on or make an observation on because they think that it's just like the dirt.

185
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,597
[SPEAKER_11] Yeah, it's like a rock or the clouds.

186
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,382
[SPEAKER_11] Yes, super basic.

187
00:10:00,402 --> 00:10:01,103
[SPEAKER_11] Yes.

188
00:10:01,123 --> 00:10:01,223
[SPEAKER_11] Cool.

189
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:15,448
[SPEAKER_08] So, some of you guys, if you've worked with Tremont before, you may have done something like this, but if you're starting from scratch, especially on a middle school level,

190
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,797
[SPEAKER_08] It's always good to invite them into play space learning with that space.

191
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:25,964
[SPEAKER_08] And so I always do this activity with my students when we go outside for the first time.

192
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:30,911
[SPEAKER_08] It's called the Level Up Challenge, and it's basically a list, and I'm gonna show a closeup of it in a second.

193
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:34,996
[SPEAKER_08] But it's a list of different observational activities you can do with your kids.

194
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:41,385
[SPEAKER_08] Some of them are super low stakes, some of them are a little more scientifically based.

195
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:44,509
[SPEAKER_08] But you can make them seasonal.

196
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,493
[SPEAKER_08] You can make them extremely localized and place-based.

197
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,416
[SPEAKER_08] You can totally tie them to your standards.

198
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:52,200
[SPEAKER_08] You can use iNaturalist as well.

199
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:56,385
[SPEAKER_08] And then on a middle school level, we assign points to them.

200
00:10:56,565 --> 00:10:59,309
[SPEAKER_08] And I say, OK, you've got 45 minutes.

201
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,571
[SPEAKER_08] Try to get 20 points.

202
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:02,734
[SPEAKER_08] If you do, you get a prize.

203
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,797
[SPEAKER_08] And the prize might be a high five.

204
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:11,085
[SPEAKER_08] The prize is sometimes when I'm feeling really generous, like a little popsicle, something like that.

205
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,254
[SPEAKER_08] Or nothing at all.

206
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:18,582
[SPEAKER_08] And what I like about this is that with the diversity of students that I have, you've got artistic ones.

207
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:20,604
[SPEAKER_08] You've got kids very scientifically minded.

208
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:24,389
[SPEAKER_08] There's really something for everybody in this when you give them that choice.

209
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,032
[SPEAKER_08] If you could go to the next slide.

210
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:28,174
[SPEAKER_08] Yes.

211
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:29,516
[SPEAKER_08] So this is kind of a close up.

212
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,621
[SPEAKER_08] This is one that Annie used recently with the class.

213
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:38,727
[SPEAKER_08] And I think you could totally do this with your high school class.

214
00:11:39,095 --> 00:11:50,269
[SPEAKER_08] Just take them anywhere outdoors and then maybe rephrase some of this with it depending on the type of observational challenges you want them to do.

215
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:52,651
[SPEAKER_02] I just have a quick question about iNaturalist.

216
00:11:52,932 --> 00:11:56,857
[SPEAKER_02] If you're doing this in the classroom, do they have their individual accounts, or do you have a classroom account?

217
00:11:56,877 --> 00:11:59,401
[SPEAKER_02] Is there a way to do a classroom account?

218
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,424
[SPEAKER_08] I was going to say, that's such a good question.

219
00:12:01,484 --> 00:12:09,355
[SPEAKER_08] The kids have to be 16 or older to have their own accounts, so I think high school, definitely, I would encourage them to do their own.

220
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:20,012
[SPEAKER_08] Well, I don't know with the new law if that's even possible, but I do a group account of my own, and then I have them use iPads that I got from a grant.

221
00:12:20,593 --> 00:12:21,735
[SPEAKER_08] So that's what I do with them.

222
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,838
[SPEAKER_08] Can you show us how to set that up at some point?

223
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:24,199
[SPEAKER_08] Yes.

224
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,084
[SPEAKER_08] And I think Amanda's, are you doing a session on iNaturalist?

225
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:29,126
[SPEAKER_08] Oh, you're not.

226
00:12:29,346 --> 00:12:30,688
[SPEAKER_08] Well, then I will definitely show you that.

227
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:31,069
[SPEAKER_08] Thank you.

228
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,251
[SPEAKER_08] Yes, I'd be happy to do that.

229
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:37,198
[SPEAKER_03] But anybody is welcome to reach out to me, and I will help with anything.

230
00:12:37,297 --> 00:12:48,867
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah, and you're such a pro at it, and there are so many nuanced things looking for data that you can find that, especially at a high school level, would be super beneficial for using place-based data.

231
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:51,870
[SPEAKER_12] Awesome, thank you.

232
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:58,776
[SPEAKER_12] Dick Krebs often uses sidewalk chalk a lot too, teaching like anatomy and stuff outside.

233
00:12:58,836 --> 00:13:07,303
[SPEAKER_12] So you could even get them, you know, he does like tasks and stuff like that, and you can give them lists and options of things that are low, low,

234
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:17,052
[SPEAKER_12] low stakes at first and then you can build up to things that are more content based or more challenging after, you know, after they're comfortable with the process and stuff like that.

235
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:20,241
[SPEAKER_08] So I always get kids cause I always do a little survey.

236
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:21,124
[SPEAKER_08] I'm like,

237
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:22,268
[SPEAKER_08] Do you like science?

238
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:23,230
[SPEAKER_08] And they all say no.

239
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,453
[SPEAKER_08] And a lot of them say it because they just don't get it.

240
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,435
[SPEAKER_08] They don't understand it.

241
00:13:26,575 --> 00:13:29,800
[SPEAKER_08] And so doing something like this engages them.

242
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:40,817
[SPEAKER_08] I mean, even touch something weird can be such a like find something outside your comfort zone and touch it is a step towards science because you're making an observation.

243
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:42,144
[SPEAKER_11] Yeah.

244
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:42,605
[SPEAKER_11] All right.

245
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:48,951
[SPEAKER_08] So another thing, this could maybe be a little more middle school, but motivating students to research.

246
00:13:49,352 --> 00:14:01,164
[SPEAKER_08] So the first one I got from the Beatles curriculum, which I know Tremont uses a lot, but it's a free resource, a lot of inquiry and observational type activities to get kids excited about being outdoors.

247
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:05,989
[SPEAKER_08] So one is we find a mystery object outdoors.

248
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,893
[SPEAKER_08] I usually bring it inside, and then we first

249
00:14:09,873 --> 00:14:25,857
[SPEAKER_08] make a lot of observations like qualitative and quantitative observations and then the next step is then we start to ask questions and then based on that observational data we start to maybe hypothesize what it is and things like that.

250
00:14:25,837 --> 00:14:36,873
[SPEAKER_08] I've done mystery objects where I give them a story like this skull was found outside with all these footprints and then there were these feathers and I create this whole scenario.

251
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:44,925
[SPEAKER_08] So at least on a middle school level it really entices them into the learning and then they're kind of hooked and they're willing to go through this process with me.

252
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:53,114
[SPEAKER_08] Back in the day, when there was Facebook, I would do more of these little templates where we would do social media profiles and things like that.

253
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:59,472
[SPEAKER_08] So going outdoors, using iNaturalist, finding something of interest, and then they would do a little research on it.

254
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:07,261
[SPEAKER_11] And this is really good also for if the weather is terrible and you have planned your entire lesson around doing something outdoors.

255
00:15:07,501 --> 00:15:14,551
[SPEAKER_11] There was a year that Jen and I had planned this beautiful lesson and we were gonna have volunteers come from Discover Life in America.

256
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:22,062
[SPEAKER_11] We had so many people come in to take our kids on hikes and do identifications in a quartering the whole time.

257
00:15:22,643 --> 00:15:26,488
[SPEAKER_11] And so we pivoted and did something more similar to this where we

258
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:34,717
[SPEAKER_11] brought samples in and it was still a really great learning experience and they had the experience of asking questions and making observations about what they had found.

259
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:46,370
[SPEAKER_00] So thinking about how we can take that like motivation that we've kind of all grow up with curiosity, right?

260
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:54,079
[SPEAKER_00] And like I'm really stuck on when I hear that kids don't like science, I'm really stuck on like

261
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:56,303
[SPEAKER_00] When did they decide to stop linking signs?

262
00:15:56,384 --> 00:16:00,179
[SPEAKER_00] It wasn't when they were like crawling around like looking for bugs under rocks, right?

263
00:16:00,661 --> 00:16:02,770
[SPEAKER_00] That's like a motivation piece that like...

264
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:10,750
[SPEAKER_00] As a high school teacher, when I see a student and they're looking at going to college and they're like, I'm not a science person when they come to my classroom.

265
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,392
[SPEAKER_00] Since when or why?

266
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:19,580
[SPEAKER_00] You've been influenced by one teacher, or maybe two, out of the world of science.

267
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,963
[SPEAKER_00] That's such a small population size.

268
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,646
[SPEAKER_00] But maybe as we teach, we think about that too.

269
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:31,153
[SPEAKER_00] Based on our approach, maybe we're really influenced by the trajectory of that student.

270
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:41,534
[SPEAKER_00] So at the high school level, I like to start off with these small little bio blitzes where students are like motivated to learn just by like interacting with things around them.

271
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:47,743
[SPEAKER_00] And then we make lists of all the things we find and then I have them write down some observations, right?

272
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:52,551
[SPEAKER_00] And then eventually they turn those observations into like questions they have.

273
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:58,087
[SPEAKER_00] So if we see a hole in a tree, maybe we turn that observation into a question.

274
00:16:58,107 --> 00:17:00,850
[SPEAKER_00] Well, I wonder how many animals live in that hole in the tree, right?

275
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:06,195
[SPEAKER_00] And right there and then we have the foundation for a lab design, right?

276
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:17,407
[SPEAKER_00] And so this is the type of stuff we do at the high school level after we make those motivational data collection points.

277
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,976
[SPEAKER_00] I think you can go to the next slide.

278
00:17:22,996 --> 00:17:29,167
[SPEAKER_00] So after we come up with our research question, then we're like, okay, what kind of qualitative data can we collect?

279
00:17:29,187 --> 00:17:32,694
[SPEAKER_00] What kind of quantitative data collection, what will that look like, right?

280
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:39,666
[SPEAKER_00] Based on our observations we had outside, what could we hope to collect data on based on that observation?

281
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:45,118
[SPEAKER_00] And so they make a list of things that they could qualitative and quantitatively collect.

282
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:50,404
[SPEAKER_00] Then we go back outside, and we see if that's viable in small little preliminary data plots.

283
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:55,170
[SPEAKER_00] Then we come back inside and collect the data.

284
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,372
[SPEAKER_00] You can go to the next slide.

285
00:17:57,954 --> 00:18:01,037
[SPEAKER_00] And we wind up with this huge data sheet.

286
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:05,943
[SPEAKER_00] And we spend time cleaning it up, and then it winds up looking something like this.

287
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,147
[SPEAKER_00] And then I have the students.

288
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:15,921
[SPEAKER_00] use that research question to inform the direction of how they process that data.

289
00:18:16,422 --> 00:18:21,533
[SPEAKER_00] So they aggregate it in however way they want to describe that data.

290
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:24,956
[SPEAKER_00] And so this process does take more than one day, right?

291
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:26,879
[SPEAKER_00] It takes like maybe three days at homework.

292
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,341
[SPEAKER_00] And if you go to the next slide.

293
00:18:28,361 --> 00:18:31,687
[SPEAKER_00] So this is kind of like the final product here and here, right?

294
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:35,473
[SPEAKER_00] We wind up analyzing some of the raw data points.

295
00:18:35,513 --> 00:18:40,061
[SPEAKER_00] We describe them with this like mean, this bar chart here.

296
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:43,887
[SPEAKER_00] We run a t-test and we see is there really a difference between the means?

297
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,233
[SPEAKER_00] And how I get them there is on the next slide.

298
00:18:47,956 --> 00:18:55,068
[SPEAKER_00] So after they do their second observation, I have all the students run these little tiny slide decks, and they talk about their research question.

299
00:18:55,388 --> 00:18:56,590
[SPEAKER_00] They go over all the basics.

300
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,632
[SPEAKER_00] What's your independent variable?

301
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,054
[SPEAKER_00] What's your dependent variable?

302
00:18:59,656 --> 00:19:08,130
[SPEAKER_00] And then they think about all the control variables they gotta think of, and I have them draw out their procedure so they know what that sample size might look like.

303
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,774
[SPEAKER_00] So they'll know what kind of materials they'll need.

304
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,889
[SPEAKER_00] And then have them make a preliminary data table for collection.

305
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:19,417
[SPEAKER_00] And they also start to envision what their graph should look like.

306
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:21,962
[SPEAKER_00] So they know exactly what direction they're going in.

307
00:19:25,108 --> 00:19:28,375
[SPEAKER_00] And following this, I can't remember what slide's next.

308
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:34,504
[SPEAKER_00] But we wind up with the option to use many different tools while playing with the data.

309
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:42,131
[SPEAKER_00] I'm obviously just using Google Sheets for data collection, data cleaning, but there are also other options for how to present that data.

310
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:45,214
[SPEAKER_00] So this is using Google Sheets.

311
00:19:45,374 --> 00:19:50,779
[SPEAKER_00] This is another program that Josh mentioned earlier called Data Classroom, which I really love.

312
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,585
[SPEAKER_00] And then there's another one that Cody will be introducing called Code App.

313
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:02,758
[SPEAKER_00] And I guess I wound up using data classroom.

314
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:10,809
[SPEAKER_00] I lean towards it because it allows students to understand descriptive and inferential statistics without having to do all the math themselves.

315
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:16,116
[SPEAKER_00] It's like a point, click, and the presentation's really descriptive, right?

316
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:25,429
[SPEAKER_00] But I guess in addition to that, this one costs money, and this one doesn't.

317
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:31,333
[SPEAKER_00] And this one also might require a little more skills and grappling from students, which also could be good.

318
00:20:32,956 --> 00:20:40,752
[SPEAKER_00] And then, as you'll be introduced to CodeApp, it's kind of a mixture of both as my position, and it's free.

319
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,161
[SPEAKER_00] Yeah.

320
00:20:43,562 --> 00:20:52,191
[SPEAKER_00] I think as a science teacher, when I started at the 11th, 12th grade level, I was not prepared for the mathematics I'd be teaching.

321
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:57,897
[SPEAKER_00] And I spent a lot of time in seeking out Josh and other people in the community to help guide me along the way.

322
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,900
[SPEAKER_00] And I guess that's how I found myself here today.

323
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:05,624
[SPEAKER_00] So yeah, that's what we wind up doing at the high school level.

324
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:11,110
[SPEAKER_00] And I think the next slide, we talk a little bit about how we aggregate some ecological data.

325
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:25,679
[SPEAKER_12] So this is, so once again we have certain classes that lend themselves to gathering data, easier or more challenging.

326
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:29,267
[SPEAKER_12] So we have state standards, we gotta focus on our state standards.

327
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:38,039
[SPEAKER_12] And I have IV standards, I have to do my IV standards, right, like I'm tested, world tested, state tested, county tested, it doesn't matter, we all have standards.

328
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,587
[SPEAKER_12] So I'm lucky that it warns itself, these particular standards, to getting me outside.

329
00:21:43,908 --> 00:21:46,411
[SPEAKER_12] But you can find ways to get you outside.

330
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:50,997
[SPEAKER_12] We already mentioned carbon cycle and water cycle, right, and looking at the balance of things and stuff like that.

331
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:54,242
[SPEAKER_12] So tomorrow we're gonna do,

332
00:21:54,222 --> 00:22:00,031
[SPEAKER_12] This is tomorrow, yeah, where we're actually gonna go out and be gathering biodiversity data.

333
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:05,820
[SPEAKER_12] And I've done this as far, and I'll set this for tomorrow, but this is our native garden.

334
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,906
[SPEAKER_12] That's great that we have a native garden, but you can do this activity without a native garden.

335
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:17,758
[SPEAKER_12] You can do it, the first time I did this, it was January, and we were freezing, and we were all outside gathering data about the grass, right?

336
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:20,702
[SPEAKER_12] Because we were seeing that there's different species in the grass.

337
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,825
[SPEAKER_12] by making those observations.

338
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,688
[SPEAKER_12] And they never knew that before.

339
00:22:25,729 --> 00:22:33,799
[SPEAKER_12] So this lends itself to my curriculum, but I can also make those connections with any cycles or anything like that too.

340
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:44,573
[SPEAKER_12] So yeah, so that's what carrying out those investigations and this science and engineering practice, sometimes we have to scaffold that for our kids.

341
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:49,980
[SPEAKER_12] But I know that on the biology test now, there are far more,

342
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:56,491
[SPEAKER_12] processing questions versus regurgitating questions, right?

343
00:22:56,611 --> 00:22:59,696
[SPEAKER_12] And so we're trying to get back in this processing mindset.

344
00:23:00,377 --> 00:23:06,526
[SPEAKER_12] COVID really knocked us all back a little bit, and now we're progressing back to we are scientists, how do we do science?

345
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:09,350
[SPEAKER_12] So that's an activity that hopefully you'll look forward to tomorrow.

346
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,795
[SPEAKER_12] Let's talk a little more middle school.

347
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:14,978
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah.

348
00:23:14,998 --> 00:23:15,799
[SPEAKER_08] All right.

349
00:23:16,842 --> 00:23:30,787
[SPEAKER_08] After going through some data explorations, things like that, what I do on the middle school level, and these are a couple standards that I tie these with, is I try to find some meaning and some sort of action students can do with their data analysis.

350
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:39,643
[SPEAKER_08] So like looking at the native and invasive species, we see that we do have native, but we do have a lot of native.

351
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:55,514
[SPEAKER_08] So some of the things that we have done is I will look to see who's in the community who might help me out and have a discussion with the students about what might be helpful with this data and we decided to identify the invasives.

352
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:59,742
[SPEAKER_08] We contacted Keaton High School Beautiful and so these are pictures of us.

353
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:03,160
[SPEAKER_08] where we pulled a bunch of invasives, bagged them up.

354
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:05,223
[SPEAKER_08] We've done campus cleanups.

355
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:07,085
[SPEAKER_08] That's a super easy one to do.

356
00:24:07,265 --> 00:24:12,072
[SPEAKER_08] I'll just take them out for about 30 minutes and we'll pick up trash that we see.

357
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:23,727
[SPEAKER_08] And I will say for middle school, this only works when there's buy-in where they're like, oh yeah, this is a problem and I'm willing to help, because oftentimes my middle schoolers don't want to pick up trash that somebody else has left.

358
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:30,015
[SPEAKER_08] But if we've talked about it in class and I've gotten them excited, they're like, oh yeah, I want to go outside, I'll do that.

359
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:33,568
[SPEAKER_08] And then what we've done recently, we got some grant money.

360
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:38,497
[SPEAKER_08] I had students use iNaturalist, identify some pollinator plants we could put in.

361
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:43,605
[SPEAKER_08] And we have now like a monarch way station with some really beautiful wildflowers.

362
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:45,468
[SPEAKER_08] But the kids did with Ms.

363
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,532
[SPEAKER_08] Parker's class and with my class.

364
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:50,378
[SPEAKER_12] I like you talking about the buy-in too.

365
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:57,854
[SPEAKER_12] I think the buy-in is important with anything, the data collection and the inquiry and the questions and getting them interested in all that.

366
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:06,533
[SPEAKER_12] Campus cleanups, one thing that we definitely teach about is runoff and fertilizer and things like that.

367
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:13,406
[SPEAKER_12] once they know about that, and they know that all drains go to the river, you know, and so yeah, I like that.

368
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:16,712
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah, I mean I've tried it where I'm like, let's just go out and clean, they're like, God no.

369
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:22,703
[SPEAKER_12] Yeah, but if they understand like where it will end up and what it will impact, yeah.

370
00:25:23,604 --> 00:25:26,209
[SPEAKER_00] The core piece here I see is like,

371
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:29,821
[SPEAKER_00] We're not just collecting data, but there's a purpose and there's communication part.

372
00:25:29,841 --> 00:25:35,769
[SPEAKER_00] Like not only did we learn about maybe what's native and non-native, but then we go and like we make a difference in the community, right?

373
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:38,433
[SPEAKER_00] Like that bigger picture, like embedding that in the system.

374
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:44,261
[SPEAKER_00] The students know like I participated in that and I understand why I did it.

375
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,683
[SPEAKER_00] And then maybe we could collect that on this.

376
00:25:45,781 --> 00:26:00,253
[SPEAKER_01] I was in Yosemite National Park before this and one of the projects that one of the guys thought up there was to do a cleanup around Curry Village, which is the campsite where everybody stays in Yosemite Valley.

377
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:02,338
[SPEAKER_01] It's a big, giant campsite.

378
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:07,283
[SPEAKER_01] But they were collecting the trash, but keeping track of exactly what trash they found and where.

379
00:26:08,264 --> 00:26:17,975
[SPEAKER_01] And they started to ask questions about it and found out that a lot of this trash is there because people who are cleaning the cabins are just sweeping a lot of stuff out of the cabins and sending them near the cabins.

380
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:26,964
[SPEAKER_01] And basically they ended up, so it enabled them to see an underlying system that was causing some of the trash and they were able to actually address that with the Curry Village staff.

381
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:29,727
[SPEAKER_01] So, I mean, cleanups are good just,

382
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:35,633
[SPEAKER_01] keep things looking clean but there's also things to be learned from that too yeah i like that i learned

383
00:26:36,068 --> 00:26:42,455
[SPEAKER_12] from tracking trash so that almost all of our plastic ends up back in Malaysia.

384
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:47,600
[SPEAKER_12] So all the plastic bags that we recycle at Walmart and stuff, they get shipped overseas.

385
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:50,023
[SPEAKER_12] They put trackers in all these different Walmarts.

386
00:26:50,063 --> 00:26:52,886
[SPEAKER_12] And then all the bags, all the trackers ended up in Malaysia.

387
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:54,988
[SPEAKER_12] So we put it on ships.

388
00:26:55,188 --> 00:26:58,732
[SPEAKER_12] And then the lady in the interview, I remember her going, sorry, this is way off track.

389
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:04,438
[SPEAKER_12] I remember her saying, it seems like America, just keep your trash, please.

390
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:21,516
[SPEAKER_08] So to support us in doing PlaySpace data collection, I'm going to go over a few free resources.

391
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:23,781
[SPEAKER_08] So this is more regional.

392
00:27:24,462 --> 00:27:26,785
[SPEAKER_08] I think it's outside of Knoxville a little bit.

393
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,628
[SPEAKER_08] I don't think they go all the way to Memphis, Tennessee.

394
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,632
[SPEAKER_08] But this is something through iNaturalist.

395
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,477
[SPEAKER_08] They will turn your schoolyard into a big biodiversity plot.

396
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:39,163
[SPEAKER_08] So this QR code goes to my site here.

397
00:27:40,064 --> 00:27:43,769
[SPEAKER_08] But when I have my students go outside, they identify species.

398
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,191
[SPEAKER_08] It's all calculated here.

399
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:47,875
[SPEAKER_08] These are the number of observations we've done.

400
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:56,268
[SPEAKER_08] And the other cool thing about it is people in the community who are in our forest can also take photos with INAT and that shows up here too.

401
00:27:56,368 --> 00:27:58,952
[SPEAKER_08] So it's really like a community project.

402
00:27:59,353 --> 00:28:01,696
[SPEAKER_08] There's a lot of cool data collection you can do with this.

403
00:28:02,678 --> 00:28:09,188
[SPEAKER_08] So I would strongly encourage you to reach out to Discover Life in America if you are interested in that.

404
00:28:09,168 --> 00:28:11,915
[SPEAKER_08] Back in the day, they would give you a free iPad too.

405
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,963
[SPEAKER_08] So yeah, Discover Life in America.

406
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:24,949
[SPEAKER_08] Julie Elfin is a new educational coordinator, so I think I have her email on one of the other slides, but she would be the person in contact.

407
00:28:25,655 --> 00:28:26,396
[SPEAKER_00] Can I pop in here?

408
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:27,257
[SPEAKER_08] Yeah.

409
00:28:27,277 --> 00:28:44,561
[SPEAKER_00] Amanda, I wonder if after this session, as we go to lunch or whatever, if you wouldn't mind showing us how to make a project at our school, and then maybe doing that other component, too, where we can have a classroom iNaturalist account or something like that, to those who are interested.

410
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:46,383
[SPEAKER_03] Yeah, that's fine.

411
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:47,044
[SPEAKER_03] I don't mind, too.

412
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:48,847
[SPEAKER_11] And I love iScience.

413
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,810
[SPEAKER_11] I'm a part of that, too.

414
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,190
[SPEAKER_11] I love it.

415
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:55,585
[SPEAKER_11] And Jen and I use this as like a leaderboard to compete between our classes.

416
00:28:55,846 --> 00:28:58,132
[SPEAKER_11] Like I have my account set up for, it's just Ms.

417
00:28:58,152 --> 00:28:59,075
[SPEAKER_11] Parker's science class.

418
00:28:59,898 --> 00:29:05,635
[SPEAKER_11] And so when you go and you look at the button right here that says observers.

419
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,877
[SPEAKER_11] It'll show you the number of observations that Ms.

420
00:29:08,897 --> 00:29:10,860
[SPEAKER_11] Parker's class has made versus Ms.

421
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,865
[SPEAKER_11] Sauer's class versus the other sixth grade science teachers.

422
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:23,300
[SPEAKER_11] And even if you aren't going to give them a popsicle for going out and making observations, that leaderboard is a really big motivator for the kids.

423
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,806
[SPEAKER_11] Competition motivates middle schoolers more than anything I've ever found.

424
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,629
[SPEAKER_11] This is very true.

425
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:28,809
[SPEAKER_11] Nice.

426
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,774
[SPEAKER_08] Fat and food.
