32.297,33.818,N/A,We're on camera.
34.372,60.244,N/A,they've got a cool correlation thing going oh yeah tell me about it okay so we kind of thought how like all species kind of interconnect within like a mini ecosystem so how they all depend like directly on the sunlight and then how these smaller organisms here at the bottom kind of like have to compete with resources from the bigger organisms oh wow and then like if you can see
60.967,61.968,N/A,It's kind of hard to see.
62.028,70.697,N/A,"It's a little blurry, but there's like moss there too where everything kind of like cycles and lives off of one other thing's waste, I guess."
70.717,71.218,N/A,That's great.

114.585,116.387,N/A,What kind of solutions do you have for that?
117.228,131.453,N/A,"I try to teach them and tell them, you know, they're not going to bother you because they're homies and this is their home and we're not going up throwing rocks at them or anything."

146.363,157.14,N/A,Usually just getting them interested in what you're doing at the beginning so giving them a purpose of why we're just not going outside to go out and we're going out there with a purpose and so usually they're kind of excited you know once they learn that and then
158.183,185.608,N/A,but yeah we're just gonna go outside they're like we really have to yeah that's true that they feel like they're excited about what you're doing i know it's awkward right it's like i can't wait till we analyze this like what is amanda doing
