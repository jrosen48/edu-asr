0.098,7.476,N/A,"Simpson's diversity in between those two, and you can kind of see because we were like, well, if they're more even, then does that indicate a higher?"
7.928,12.733,N/A,"biodiversity index, and so what we found out is no, not necessarily."
14.395,26.288,N/A,"And so we put our Simpsons diversity with a group, so that's why I put that data back here is because if you were like, well I can't see all that data together, well now you can see this one had less richness, right?"
26.769,34.538,N/A,"And that was our score here, whereas like this one, not necessarily as even, but it had a much higher NDC."
35.298,37.581,N/A,So that was our major question.
39.147,42.11,N/A,"Yeah, and even then, even down here, too."
42.831,44.854,N/A,Go back to your models again a second.
44.874,47.497,N/A,"Sorry, I forgot exactly how it works."
47.517,47.957,N/A,More even populations.
47.977,50.04,N/A,Compared to rich populations have higher biodiversity.
52.523,52.723,N/A,More even.
52.743,55.586,N/A,More even would calculate a higher diversity index.
56.027,65.037,N/A,"So I was going with the numbers she originally gave, which showed us that even the area that had more evenness had a higher biodiversity."
67.025,68.367,N/A,It was this one.
68.427,70.088,N/A,Then you go back to your table.
70.108,75.675,N/A,"Because we were like, because in my student mind, I'm like, well, that one's more biodiverse because it's got more richness."
75.855,77.136,N/A,It's got more different species in it.
77.417,79.399,N/A,So it's filling more niches in different ways.
80.18,84.825,N/A,But there's only two.
84.845,87.288,N/A,And kids want to kind of come up with a fact.
87.308,89.23,N/A,"So I could see them, oh, look, that one's even, and it's always going to be higher if it's even."
89.25,90.932,N/A,"And then all of a sudden, it's like, so now you're proving, hey, you can't just say."
90.952,96.238,N/A,"Yeah, you can't just say, yeah, because of this and what I'm looking at, it's not necessarily biodiverse."
96.725,107.055,N/A,"And so right here, yeah."
111.676,115.623,N/A,their richness is real low but their evenness is also real low.
115.643,132.992,N/A,Right and that's when then that's when I started digging further I'm like well how does the Simpson actually really show biodiversity because in the student mind like I'm just putting a bunch of numbers together and then I'm getting this decimal and you're telling me the higher the number the more biodiversity
132.972,147.049,N/A,"but I don't know, then I started digging and it says basically, because I've used the Shannon index too, but Shannon index really focuses and allows you to elaborate on species richness, like it actually"
148.058,156.206,N/A,"is a heavier number whenever you use the Shandon with the number of species richness, whereas the Simpson really hones in on evenness more."
156.987,162.252,N/A,"So it's a really weird dynamic, and I don't know if I could explain that effectively to my kids."
164.374,167.277,N/A,"So it just kind of led me down a rabbit hole, is what it did."
167.297,174.103,N/A,"No, I absolutely, I asked that same question when we were looking at it, and I just kind of like, I don't have time to do that."
174.123,177.947,N/A,"I thought, I wondered about the same, nearly the exact same thing."
179.412,181.698,N/A,So that's it.
181.718,182.822,N/A,Then I got distracted by ours.
183.082,184.807,N/A,So this is where we were at.
184.988,190.182,N/A,And that's why I included the chart with all the numbers and the evenness percentages.
193.942,201.915,N/A,"Well, I don't know if we could because you don't see the evenness numbers."
202.936,206.082,N/A,So I don't think you could do an average for this because that was part of the question.
206.102,208.305,N/A,"It's kind of being able to see the evenness, right?"
208.345,211.09,N/A,The percentages versus our Simpsons diversity.
211.11,214.415,N/A,"But if I put those two together, it makes no sense on a graph."
215.236,218.722,N/A,It doesn't make sense.
218.742,220.084,N/A,Lots of rabbit holes.
225.548,238.262,N/A,"and then the evenness aspect of diversity and what really is biodiversity and what are these different formulas actually measuring, what aspect of biodiversity."
238.862,239.403,N/A,Yeah.
239.423,239.523,N/A,Yeah.
239.543,241.325,N/A,Diverse is your species population.
241.345,241.545,N/A,Right.
241.565,244.849,N/A,All of the toads are from one clutch of parents.
244.869,248.413,N/A,"Yeah, so it's characteristic diversity too, you know, trait diversity."
248.433,253.378,N/A,"So it's like you can't, I don't know, you can't encompass it in one number."
256.75,271.62,N/A,Did you grab one?
271.821,273.544,N/A,"Oh, I put it on."
289.353,293.507,N/A,I'm not going to be the one doing a lot of the talking to.
308.185,312.716,N/A,that ours looks very different than what high school teachers are going to be teaching.
313.899,323.241,N/A,So we stuck with the original essential question and we originally had said it's pretty healthy because of the observable diversity in plants and animals in the area.
341.935,351.151,N/A,So it would be harder for us to teach at the fifth and sixth grade specifically level how to incorporate all of these other ideas.
351.211,354.496,N/A,"So in sticking with the numbers that we were given, they're still using data."
354.556,355.698,N/A,They're still processing it.
355.718,364.192,N/A,They're still analyzing it and then being able to figure out what their confidence level is once they reach a conclusion based on what is there.
364.213,365.715,N/A,And they did collect it directly.
390.772,402.41,N/A,But we did come up with a rubric for their presentation because we didn't have to die.
402.43,417.994,N/A,"And one note is just like to that point, my sixth graders don't learn about x and y coordinates or x and y axes until mid spring semester until a lot of the things that we would do with them like data"
428.133,433.479,N/A,percent out of 100 or to look at different bars and compare them.
433.499,447.974,N/A,But I really like how you all did this and built to your students' strengths and what you know they can do and really to work on those thinking skills.
447.994,452.379,N/A,I really like your rubric because we absolutely completely forgot to do it.
452.459,453.22,N/A,We ran out of time.
453.24,454.461,N/A,We didn't forget to do it.
459.773,489.139,N/A,schoolers all between three and four
489.811,491.134,N/A,"Yeah, that's what we used."
491.655,493.478,N/A,That's exactly what we used.
493.638,497.506,N/A,"No, everything is fine."
497.586,498.468,N/A,Go back to your slides.
498.488,499.049,N/A,It's all good.
499.41,501.073,N/A,This is high schoolers.
501.273,507.465,N/A,What did they use instead of that we didn't?
509.521,520.462,N/A,"Okay, so at the beginning we discussed how the one that I taught you guys is not helpful unless there's a comparing plots."
520.522,521.364,N/A,Look at all their numbers.
521.524,526.213,N/A,So which site is even close to 0.8?
538.664,550.21,N/A,It was you guys who did the edge potluck.
567.875,582.492,N/A,"I wasn't there for the data collection, I'm just here."
585.492,605.526,N/A,"So let me say like exactly what I like that when you go to the internet and it says like Simpson's diversity index, right?"
605.506,607.849,N/A,"What it's actually doing, I believe, is the inverse."
607.869,611.695,N/A,"Because I had a kid last year in his IA, his big lab report, that came in with all these numbers."
611.735,612.616,N/A,"And I was like, whoa, whoa, where?"
612.776,613.838,N/A,Where'd you get these?
613.858,617.002,N/A,And then I made him do all the Simpson's Index by hand.
618.224,623.772,N/A,So I think that what I've been doing is perhaps not the most valuable.
623.972,626.856,N/A,And I think Simpson's inverse seems like the way to go.
626.896,629.48,N/A,Those three point whatevers are good.
631.002,632.965,N/A,Kids can identify with them better.
633.35,641.57,N/A,they're better integers than numbers between zero and one.
641.59,651.274,N/A,Whereas I think for middle school though it might be better because it'll fit into the hundred percent like that kind of deal.
661.953,678.763,N/A,But this is iNaturalist data.
692.159,693.341,N/A,And I didn't know what it is.
693.361,695.404,N/A,I literally learned this today.
695.725,696.586,N/A,I have no idea.
696.987,699.731,N/A,So I've learned so much from this session.
699.751,701.794,N/A,Look at that!
702.535,703.377,N/A,Great job.
703.477,704.118,N/A,Very cool.
704.238,710.488,N/A,I learned something if no one else did.
