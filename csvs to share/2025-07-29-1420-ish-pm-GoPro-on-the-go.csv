0.284,0.765,N/A,Yeah.
1.866,3.869,N/A,We recorded a lot of the bear on here.
4.129,4.489,N/A,"Oh, really?"
4.509,4.63,N/A,Yeah.
4.65,6.272,N/A,This is the bear origin spot.
6.372,6.752,N/A,Welcome.
7.754,7.954,N/A,Yeah.
8.194,9.396,N/A,Tell us about your bear origin.
9.796,17.807,N/A,"Well, there's a log down here at the bottom that the bear was rolling over and getting under and he's looking for other things out of there."
18.207,22.272,N/A,"Yeah, we saw him doing similar, but pulling bark off and stuff."
22.292,22.392,N/A,Yeah.
22.633,24.876,N/A,And then he started climbing up the hill.
24.936,25.937,N/A,"Oh yeah, good job."
26.238,27.119,N/A,I was a little nervous.
27.139,30.222,N/A,Ann nicely told him that we loved him and he needed to go someplace else.
30.242,30.842,N/A,"Oh, he came to us."
31.203,33.905,N/A,So he came to y'all.
33.945,34.485,N/A,He avoided us.
34.866,37.869,N/A,"But he was our guest speaker, which is what took us so long."
38.129,41.111,N/A,We have all of the class with us now instead of just two.
41.232,42.593,N/A,We're a big group.
42.653,43.634,N/A,A big group.
43.774,48.438,N/A,We're going to have a big group lesson.
48.458,49.719,N/A,"Vincent, you got this?"
49.739,49.839,N/A,What?
49.859,50.58,N/A,You guys remember?
50.78,52.442,N/A,So we're looking at ferns.
52.462,52.742,N/A,Yes.
52.762,54.424,N/A,I love ferns.
54.444,56.025,N/A,"And this fern in particular,"
56.174,60.219,N/A,There are two different ferns around.
60.279,61.56,N/A,So we're looking at these.
61.961,65.785,N/A,If you can find something that looks pretty similar to that guy.
65.825,70.711,N/A,I'll come down the road here and see if I can help find one.
71.131,73.914,N/A,That's the kind we're looking at right there.
74.495,80.562,N/A,"So when you see that fern, what does the first thought come to you of"
81.115,82.316,N/A,That's a sock.
82.336,82.837,N/A,Is that what you said?
83.057,83.898,N/A,"I mean, what does it look like?"
84.219,86.502,N/A,What kind of object does it look like?
87.162,88.364,N/A,Christmas tree sock.
88.384,90.226,N/A,Is that what they're supposed to be?
90.246,90.827,N/A,You know too much.
90.847,95.192,N/A,"You know this, right?"
95.212,99.417,N/A,That kid selling answers down the mountain.
99.437,100.198,N/A,"Dude, that's the thing."
100.218,102.0,N/A,I don't know.
102.04,103.342,N/A,Not that one.
103.502,104.203,N/A,It's this one.
104.47,106.012,N/A,Wood ferns are really common.
106.072,107.814,N/A,I forget like how to tell them apart.
107.934,110.978,N/A,What kind of common name?
111.378,116.264,N/A,He's already gave the real name.
116.504,120.609,N/A,Well the fern we're looking at is this fern right here.
120.629,122.311,N/A,Well you already know what you're going to do.
122.371,123.533,N/A,I don't know why I'm telling you.
123.553,125.916,N/A,What kind of common name do you want to give that fern?
125.956,130.241,N/A,"If you're the science person who gets to come and name it, what are you going to name it?"
130.962,131.322,N/A,Okay.
131.757,133.6,N/A,"Is that good, other people?"
133.68,136.223,N/A,I think they all know it.
136.264,137.105,N/A,You don't get to name it.
137.626,141.471,N/A,"That's probably why we break up in smaller groups, right?"
141.511,142.873,N/A,That bird just calls a ruckus.
143.574,147.199,N/A,"Let's just keep going, huh?"
147.219,148.021,N/A,You guys want to come with us?
149.182,150.164,N/A,This is the end of the line.
150.484,155.892,N/A,"Even if you know the name of it, what else might you name it?"
156.682,160.168,N/A,for all you answer knowers who know what every plant in the forest is.
162.411,163.373,N/A,Green fern.
164.374,165.035,N/A,Green fern.
165.135,169.843,N/A,"Green fern number one, green fern number two, fern number three."
169.863,170.624,N/A,Sketchy fern.
170.744,172.968,N/A,This is why I didn't go into biology people.
174.17,176.413,N/A,Chemistry has a whole set of how to name things.
176.433,177.195,N/A,There's no guess in it.
177.435,182.243,N/A,I was a zoology major and when I graduated I didn't know I wanted to be a teacher yet.
182.263,183.685,N/A,I was like maybe I'll go to grad school.
184.238,186.06,N/A,"So I was like, oh, I'll take the biology GRE."
186.501,189.464,N/A,"Never thinking, oh, I've never taken a botany class."
189.704,191.266,N/A,The whole time showed up.
191.286,192.307,N/A,It's like half plants.
192.367,195.811,N/A,"I'm like, oh, well, this is a bust."
195.971,197.953,N/A,Time to strap on my pants.
198.054,198.354,N/A,All right.
198.374,198.594,N/A,All right.
198.614,200.256,N/A,"Well, these are your Christmas ferns."

200.496,201.798,N/A,We're the last ones.
201.978,202.819,N/A,So you'll join us?
203.099,203.4,N/A,I am.
203.56,206.723,N/A,"I was going to get their video clip, but we're good now."
206.843,209.446,N/A,We're just going to turn around and go on up.
209.466,210.988,N/A,They know what the ferns are.
210.968,214.513,N/A,All waves and good vibes and no more bears for now.
214.533,215.314,N/A,We're all together now.
215.334,217.317,N/A,I think Grayson's in front of us actually.
217.337,217.618,N/A,Yeah.
217.638,218.719,N/A,Let's be gone.
218.879,219.701,N/A,Ooh.
219.801,220.181,N/A,Ooh.
221.723,224.968,N/A,"Ooh, I love the hole in this tree."
225.068,227.912,N/A,It looks like a good home.
227.932,230.136,N/A,Does it look like a good home?
230.156,235.804,N/A,I absolutely found a mother raccoon and some babies.
235.824,237.847,N/A,I absolutely found a mother raccoon and some babies in a hole like that.
237.867,240.771,N/A,We're going to teach Grayson before we go.
240.831,240.891,N/A,Oh.
241.394,244.717,N/A,"Oh, want to teach Grayson?"
245.137,245.838,N/A,Yes.
245.858,246.058,N/A,All right.
246.318,247.199,N/A,Who is Grayson again?
247.219,249.181,N/A,A giant snowball effect.
250.062,251.243,N/A,"Oh, goodness gracious."
253.645,253.705,N/A,OK.
253.725,255.947,N/A,I heard something about ferns.
255.967,256.447,N/A,You did.
256.607,260.831,N/A,"We are finding a new common name for this fern, which you know the name of."
261.151,261.431,N/A,Right.
261.512,261.832,N/A,Yes.
262.172,271.14,N/A,"So if you didn't name it that, what would you want to name it?"
271.16,271.3,N/A,Hi.
273.659,284.452,N/A,"I think that I would name it, uh, let's see, the Feathered Flutterfern."
284.472,285.213,N/A,"Ooh, that's nice."
285.233,285.573,N/A,"Ooh, I love it."
285.593,286.875,N/A,All of all the alliteration.
287.195,288.196,N/A,I like the jazzing up of that.
288.216,288.517,N/A,Yes.
288.917,290.118,N/A,"To me, it's the ferniest fern."
290.419,290.739,N/A,Yeah.
290.759,300.551,N/A,"These are, these are very feathery and I can imagine it being like a nice dramatic language of fans in the moment."
300.871,301.692,N/A,Nice.
301.942,302.583,N/A,Fern dance.
302.863,305.347,N/A,I'm impressed.
305.787,307.45,N/A,You've heard of river dance?
307.47,308.672,N/A,We do fern dance here.
308.872,313.538,N/A,"You dramatically signal my fern to be like, you have displeased me."
313.558,316.783,N/A,That's how we're going to run off the next bear.
317.464,318.485,N/A,Fern dance.
318.565,323.753,N/A,"It'll be so bizarre and upsetting that the bear will be like, no, I'm not doing that."
323.933,327.959,N/A,White people are crazy.
327.979,328.339,N/A,Awesome.
328.419,328.84,N/A,All right.
329.681,329.982,N/A,All right.
330.562,331.003,N/A,Good deal.
331.355,332.582,N/A,So now we go.
332.622,338.175,N/A,The masses to go through.
340.315,342.277,N/A,We were patient for a moment.
342.297,343.619,N/A,Where was it headed?
343.879,345.4,N/A,You know the Tulip Poplar Station?
345.961,346.121,N/A,Oh yeah.
346.141,350.866,N/A,About where we had been standing when we came up to see it from another angle.
350.886,351.547,N/A,Oh my gosh.
351.607,355.551,N/A,"And then he waited a minute and then he was like, you know what, that's a good place to cross the trail."
356.532,357.073,N/A,And that's what he did.
357.093,360.397,N/A,And we went up and tore the bark off of some fallen trees.
362.699,365.562,N/A,Do you think he's old enough that his mama's not around anymore?
365.582,368.145,N/A,"Yes, he's a yearling."
368.918,375.098,N/A,"And I'm wondering if it is Cubby, the unaccompanied minor we were seeing last spring."
375.972,379.196,N/A,"And I want to believe that Cubby became a healthy, independent bear."
381.419,385.244,N/A,Unaccompanied in terms of something desperate may have happened to its parent.
385.264,389.13,N/A,We never saw any indication that he was being cared for by a parent.
390.131,396.039,N/A,So we think probably mama got hit by a car or something.
396.059,400.064,N/A,"But each time we saw him, he was a little further from Tremont and a little bit bigger and healthier."
400.084,400.925,N/A,"Well, that's good."
400.945,401.787,N/A,That's a good sign.
402.207,402.908,N/A,Good evidence.
404.356,407.301,N/A,There's evidence in a nutshell.
408.063,410.066,N/A,My data growth mindset.
410.086,410.928,N/A,Oh yeah.
412.711,413.752,N/A,Put you with some jargon.
414.494,417.459,N/A,Some jargon that I haven't heard a long time.
417.499,424.051,N/A,Next time we'll give it letters and then nobody else will know what we're talking about.
424.752,425.453,N/A,I'm down with it.
426.428,431.175,N/A,So you gave us that great graduation music.
431.576,435.281,N/A,And now it's time for you to make your own.
435.562,437.885,N/A,The forest is your orchestra.
438.526,443.053,N/A,All you need to do is come up with a name for your band.
445.517,446.398,N/A,Make some music and have some fun.
446.418,448.822,N/A,Do I have some band names ready to go?
449.563,450.284,N/A,And it can't be Styx.
450.605,451.225,N/A,Or Berry Styx.
451.426,453.489,N/A,Or Styx and Stonehenge.
453.529,454.19,N/A,Or Tree Beats.
454.831,455.592,N/A,Trees Beats.
456.263,460.829,N/A,"All right, what style of music are we going to make?"
460.849,461.87,N/A,I think you're off to a good start right now.
462.651,469.319,N/A,Yeah.
469.339,472.063,N/A,Just keep going.
472.083,472.864,N/A,Just keep going.
472.944,481.174,N/A,I don't know about all that.
489.558,490.319,N/A,You got those bars?
491.982,492.563,N/A,About to spit?
493.965,494.526,N/A,That fire.
499.955,504.583,N/A,"Well, we all the way up."
508.91,510.773,N/A,We saw a bear and we all the way.
511.58,511.86,N/A,Up!
512.081,515.006,N/A,"Alright, so we're the ups."
515.727,516.328,N/A,There we go.
516.409,516.889,N/A,We're the ups.
517.05,517.871,N/A,Okay!
518.031,519.835,N/A,I like the way it didn't work out.
519.895,521.397,N/A,"Grayson, are we waiting for you?"
521.418,522.419,N/A,Grayson's coming up.
523.321,523.782,N/A,Alright.
524.243,525.324,N/A,Grayson's a one woman show.
525.365,526.406,N/A,That's all I got left.
526.426,529.492,N/A,"Will we wait for you, Grayson?"
531.536,531.816,N/A,Yeah.
534.8,535.681,N/A,So we made a beat.
536.703,538.205,N/A,We're our artists now.
539.027,542.713,N/A,We're called Up because we all the way up.
544.716,546.679,N/A,We saw a bear and we're all the way up.
552.428,553.37,N/A,The bear was rapping too.
553.41,554.952,N/A,The bear was rapping on bark.
557.024,559.227,N/A,He was spitting some bark lyrics.
560.789,562.892,N/A,Spitting them barks.
567.719,568.32,N/A,"Oh, goodness."
571.084,573.568,N/A,"Hope I got plenty of footage on your camera, this camera."
574.129,576.452,N/A,"I think I did, even though I didn't want to get any closer."
579.116,579.336,N/A,Oh.
588.395,595.502,N/A,I'm going to check you guys for ticks.
595.642,596.062,N/A,"Oh, nice."
596.083,598.605,N/A,Thanks for the heads up.
598.625,601.768,N/A,So take a look around you.
603.93,606.593,N/A,Lots of trees in the canopy.
607.053,613.62,N/A,Do y'all see anything that kind of stands out to you as unseasonal for July?
613.74,616.022,N/A,What do you notice over there yonder?
616.643,622.698,N/A,Why wouldn't that be seasonal for July?
623.881,625.284,N/A,Because usually they do that in the fall.
627.249,628.071,N/A,Looks like fall.
629.182,631.846,N/A,So does that mean there's not enough water in the forest right now?
632.086,649.75,N/A,"Well, your job is to tell us, in addition to that wonderful idea, we would like to hear one more hypothesis for why, and then we would also like to hear one absolutely ridiculous hypothesis that you think there's no way it's true, but it would be fun if it was."
651.232,653.856,N/A,"We've heard aliens, giants,"
654.832,656.755,N/A,I can't wait to see the senioritis.
658.017,660.22,N/A,"Senior treat, senior leaves that are just done."
660.261,661.422,N/A,They're just over it.
661.462,663.185,N/A,"They're like, I'm not doing green anymore, y'all."
663.205,664.527,N/A,I've done green for all my life.
666.37,669.255,N/A,I like that one.
670.877,671.679,N/A,Midlife crisis.
671.699,673.001,N/A,Midlife crisis.
673.021,673.561,N/A,That's good.
674.323,676.907,N/A,"Meteor crisis, maybe."
677.187,678.169,N/A,"Yes, quarter life crisis."
681.534,682.155,N/A,Any ideas?
683.35,685.813,N/A,Uh... You can start with reasonable if you want.
685.873,686.493,N/A,We're silly.
690.497,697.605,N/A,"I've been reading a lot about trees, and it's got to... I think the most reasonable thing I can think of is the tree is conserving energy somehow."
697.725,700.688,N/A,That's why I'm not chlorophylling all of itself.
702.07,703.571,N/A,I just burbed a noun.
703.591,704.112,N/A,I apologize.
704.452,706.014,N/A,"Yes, you did."
706.034,706.314,N/A,I liked it.
706.334,706.554,N/A,"Well, good."
706.574,706.674,N/A,Okay.
706.734,709.257,N/A,Any other that could not possibly be true?
709.49,717.903,N/A,Well maybe there's a dragon that is planting them there as keys to another universe.
717.923,719.806,N/A,Do we have to collect them?
719.966,720.266,N/A,Yeah.
