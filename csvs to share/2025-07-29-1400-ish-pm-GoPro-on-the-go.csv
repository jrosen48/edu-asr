0.115,9.065,N/A,We're all within our group back on the trail.
10.146,17.093,N/A,"You heard that I am not outdoorsy, but I am a gardener."
18.014,19.096,N/A,"Kind of crazy, isn't it?"
20.217,22.259,N/A,"But if you find your niche, you just start to roll with it."
23.28,24.081,N/A,"I'm no hiker, though."
25.006,28.17,N/A,"Hiking is not my life, but hiking is a great thing to do."
28.311,35.1,N/A,"Everyone can find small trails, short trails, or you can be a biker and bike on trails that are for bikes only."
39.306,42.811,N/A,I think we're coming to our first checkpoint.
42.831,43.612,N/A,We have a traffic jam.
44.934,50.001,N/A,"Always a traffic jam, that's what we're going to call it."
58.25,60.572,N/A,We see more out here.
60.592,64.255,N/A,A lot of nice looking forestry.
65.536,69.92,N/A,That is definitely worth gandering at.
70.981,73.683,N/A,We have a ride out tree trunk right here.
75.224,76.685,N/A,That has long since been gone.
78.167,81.349,N/A,We are now crossing up the rocks and going to our checkpoint.
82.971,83.631,N/A,Reach.
83.992,88.155,N/A,What do you guys see in this area that might have been different than your hike up?
89.401,92.545,N/A,Is there anything else?
92.785,94.067,N/A,Berries.
94.087,94.828,N/A,"Okay, berries."
94.888,96.289,N/A,Let's focus.
96.95,100.234,N/A,We have this area of observation over here.
100.374,101.396,N/A,You can even see up there.
101.496,107.363,N/A,"It continues on the sides, but we want you to focus on this little berry right here."
108.244,108.985,N/A,There's one there.
109.185,113.891,N/A,And then you guys are going to try to notice the difference.
113.991,116.254,N/A,It's got two.
116.834,117.315,N/A,Yes.
117.447,120.773,N/A,So what do you think is those two points?
121.114,121.795,N/A,Like what is it from?
122.897,126.744,N/A,And what could possibly be unique about that berry besides the two points?
132.354,139.827,N/A,Well it could be from... What do fruit produce?
139.958,140.539,N/A,Seeds.
140.679,143.202,N/A,"Okay, so how many seeds do you think might be inside?"
143.323,144.184,N/A,Two.
144.204,144.444,N/A,Two.
144.464,146.227,N/A,"Okay, and question?"
146.547,149.051,N/A,So how do you think it came to be that berry?
149.291,151.754,N/A,Like what would create that berry?
152.275,153.817,N/A,Like how would it be reproduced?
154.919,156.261,N/A,With the egg and the sperm.
157.522,159.085,N/A,"A flower, okay."
159.165,166.194,N/A,"So if there's two seeds, double fertilization like two eggs and two sperm."
166.214,166.675,N/A,So two
167.296,189.237,N/A,two flowers yeah two flowers and you can taste it it's edible and it's just kind of like it tastes like air yeah you're not gonna get nutrients from it i've eaten them before i don't need to eat them again it tastes like um you can find the citrusy air taste the two seeds though they are two seeds yeah and you can like individually like pop it out immediately
189.217,190.339,N/A,Yep.
190.419,192.041,N/A,And it's called Partridge Berry.
192.542,193.223,N/A,Partridge Berry.
193.463,196.046,N/A,So it looks like the next group's coming up.
196.066,197.609,N/A,That was all we had for you guys.
197.669,198.75,N/A,Thank you so much.
199.091,199.852,N/A,We loved it.
200.272,201.414,N/A,Yes.
201.434,202.616,N/A,Do you all want this back?
202.656,203.256,N/A,There you go.
203.737,204.478,N/A,It's all yours.
204.578,210.286,N/A,It's not snack time yet.
210.406,211.107,N/A,Up the trail we go.
211.127,212.489,N/A,That was the first checkpoint.
212.629,216.675,N/A,"And as we walk, we're going to look at the"
218.579,222.144,N/A,"downhill, you can hear the river, the waterway."
222.865,226.991,N/A,I'm not going to walk that far down because I could topple and I don't have insurance that can cover all that.
228.172,231.817,N/A,So we're going to continue to trek uphill with my partners.
233.459,241.931,N/A,"As you see over here, you see all the greenery that is being shown or being produced by nature."
243.053,246.257,N/A,We see some pine
247.672,249.735,N/A,Can you say a pine tree or something close to that?
249.755,251.318,N/A,That is up here.
252.42,264.018,N/A,"That is not quite your Christmas tree, but you know, it could be something to take home if you so choose to."
265.741,266.783,N/A,But you have to hike to get it.
270.969,272.211,N/A,We have this interesting tree right here.
272.272,274.455,N/A,"It looks like a twig, a tall twig."
277.658,278.88,N/A,It strikes your imagination.
278.9,279.722,N/A,Look at that imagination.
279.742,280.002,N/A,Look at.
284.991,290.742,N/A,Now we're getting to our second checkpoint as we cross the threshold of this trail.
299.438,299.498,N/A,OK.
300.119,303.884,N/A,We need you to touch this leaf and tell us what you feel.
304.785,306.647,N/A,It's a sensory station.
306.908,307.128,N/A,Yes.
307.408,307.889,N/A,Sensory station.
307.909,308.63,N/A,It's so soft.
309.171,310.112,N/A,It is soft.
310.132,311.594,N/A,It's like a silk blanket.
311.614,312.375,N/A,There you go.
312.395,314.498,N/A,"This is, there's so much better than the other group."
314.798,315.879,N/A,They're very indirect.
315.899,316.02,N/A,Yeah.
316.12,317.882,N/A,They said it was a sensory.
318.383,320.205,N/A,It's all about our delivery.
320.465,321.907,N/A,But the underside is veiny.
322.087,323.209,N/A,Yeah.
325.752,326.053,N/A,Okay.
326.153,327.915,N/A,What kind of tree does it remind you of?
329.228,334.596,N/A,Reminds me of a maple.
334.616,335.697,N/A,I almost thought aloe.
336.639,338.602,N/A,"Oh, aloe's a good one."
339.623,340.344,N/A,Because it's smooth.
340.905,341.326,N/A,Yes.
341.426,344.47,N/A,"So you're right, maple, because it has these little guys."
344.69,347.895,N/A,I said tulip poplar because I didn't see these by the way she was holding it.
349.057,352.583,N/A,So that's a very special leaf you want to know how to locate.
353.465,354.727,N/A,It is indeed a maple.
354.827,356.169,N/A,It's a striped.
356.89,357.532,N/A,And how do we know?
357.832,363.201,N/A,Maple because on the bark there's these little stripe marks.
363.221,369.512,N/A,And so it is a safe leaf that you need if you are in need.
370.319,371.881,N/A,It's the Charmin of the Woods.
373.183,374.185,N/A,Charmin of the Woods.
374.225,375.367,N/A,That's why you guys did so great.
375.387,375.968,N/A,For the toiletries.
375.988,382.318,N/A,You totally picked up on the fact that it was totally safe.
382.778,384.2,N/A,"Excellent, excellent job."
384.421,385.983,N/A,And the Charmin is free.
386.043,387.566,N/A,The Charmin is free.
387.586,389.328,N/A,The Charmin is free.
390.11,392.053,N/A,I'm all sweaty.
393.114,396.259,N/A,Nobody in there.
396.239,400.803,N/A,So we just found some Charmin in the forest.
403.145,404.066,N/A,It cost you nothing.
405.568,407.91,N/A,Just make sure you have some hand sanitizer afterwards.
409.371,414.896,N/A,"Or maybe even some hand wipes, you know, to wipe it."
415.157,416.017,N/A,Maybe a little shovel.
416.057,416.978,N/A,A little shovel too.
417.879,423.124,N/A,So you can distance yourself from the scent both
425.618,447.154,N/A,never mind cut edit restart you see where this fell down yeah and all this is new like all this is all this quick growing that has popped up yeah
449.75,454.416,N/A,Just because it topples is that does not mean it will not be an asset to nature.
454.476,455.116,N/A,That's right.
455.497,458.641,N/A,All these these become nurse logs.
460.243,460.383,N/A,Mm hmm.
460.403,460.924,N/A,You get stuck.
461.164,461.905,N/A,They're already doing it.
461.925,464.688,N/A,They've already got mushrooms all over.
464.708,477.023,N/A,My father in law is 60 and he was tied up with an extension
477.543,480.326,N/A,"We're coming to our third checkpoint, I do believe."
481.408,486.914,N/A,After we looked at this nice set of toppled trees and whatnot.
487.035,491.921,N/A,Lots of downed trees.
493.863,496.907,N/A,These are really big leaves.
496.927,499.069,N/A,Why would a plant have really big leaves?
499.089,500.051,N/A,To get more sun.
500.631,506.098,N/A,Maybe because it's diffused light and it has to spread itself out to get light.
510.871,520.324,N/A,"And like the stems are not woody and kind of light so they're probably quick to grow, fast to grow."
521.405,526.152,N/A,So we've got some other plants that there are a lot of.
526.172,529.477,N/A,Could it not also be a... Mushrooms are not plants.
529.537,533.242,N/A,They're actually a... Fungus.
533.302,535.565,N/A,A heterotroph as opposed to an autotroph.
535.585,535.685,N/A,Okay.
535.705,538.549,N/A,We're more closely related to fungi than plants are.
538.799,541.784,N/A,"Wouldn't these plants serve as food for animals, too?"
541.804,542.846,N/A,"They would, for sure."
543.527,547.012,N/A,But we've got a lot of one type of plant growing in this area.
547.854,549.637,N/A,These little hourglassy things?
549.657,551.219,N/A,"Yeah, these little hourglassy things."
551.74,554.905,N/A,That's a tulip poplar.
554.925,557.75,N/A,"A tulip poplar, which is also apparently the state tree of Tennessee."
558.691,559.272,N/A,Did not know that.
560.534,563.98,N/A,I think I've been told that before.
564.652,565.553,N/A,And they get big.
565.593,566.414,N/A,They get huge.
566.434,566.894,N/A,They do.
566.934,568.476,N/A,There's actually a few of them right over there.
568.676,572.04,N/A,I believe that's one right behind Jen.
579.047,590.659,N/A,They are early on the succession list because they are fast growing with those nice broad leaves for lots of energy harnessing.
592.715,619.667,N/A,energy or sorry photosynthetic energy is uh they're very good at harvesting photosynthetic energy because of their large leaves there we go yes there's a coherent thought you hear that camera thank you a really big one of those things that we yeah those are the broadleaf plantain thank you appreciation
623.005,623.726,N/A,Do you know that bird?
624.747,625.627,N/A,I do not know that bird.
626.328,628.29,N/A,It's the loudest bird in the forest.
628.31,628.971,N/A,The Carolina Wren.
629.791,630.372,N/A,It's a what again?
630.612,631.493,N/A,Carolina Wren.
632.133,633.114,N/A,"Oh, a Carolina Wren."
633.215,637.759,N/A,I call it the loudest bird in the forest because it is.
637.939,638.359,N/A,Look how little.
643.324,643.404,N/A,Hmm.
643.424,644.445,N/A,Making that big old noise.
646.547,649.89,N/A,"Had some big lungs, I guess, that we can't see something."
654.764,676.791,N/A,"So this section of the trail, what sort of new thing caught your eye as you were walking up?"
676.831,678.373,N/A,Like a little white mushroom.
679.775,680.676,N/A,That's the thing.
680.716,681.497,N/A,Okay.
682.169,698.558,N/A,so we were tasked with having you guys find the beginning middle and end of the life cycle of this mushroom yeah okay and you find it in three different cycles if it's fruiting life so
703.111,706.176,N/A,Some of them are round and closed and some of them are open.
706.356,708.38,N/A,Is the opening part a phase?
709.441,710.783,N/A,Is that the final phase?
711.024,712.126,N/A,Here's an open one.
712.586,714.53,N/A,This is closed and that one's open.
715.191,718.276,N/A,"Yeah, but then I think... There's a medium."
718.596,721.561,N/A,"Yeah, so that's the end phase and the closed is the beginning."
721.581,724.005,N/A,What do you think the middle phase would look like then?
726.652,751.748,N/A,a little bit open yeah say it again this is the middle stage no this is the beginning beginning and then that's the end more like the end phases what would be the middle phase like this one right here with a little open i think that's a bug hole i think
752.285,752.726,N/A,A what?
752.886,753.347,N/A,A buckle?
753.647,755.23,N/A,A bug hole?
755.71,758.174,N/A,You know bug holes?
758.815,759.917,N/A,You know bug holes?
760.097,761.94,N/A,They're like muggles except bugles.
762.14,763.062,N/A,I thought you said buckle.
763.202,764.304,N/A,In the bug hole.
764.764,765.766,N/A,The bug hole?
765.986,766.567,N/A,No.
767.569,768.61,N/A,I don't see one.
768.671,770.293,N/A,Do you see one that's different than those?
771.505,776.092,N/A,So I kind of feel like this one is a middle phase.
776.113,778.797,N/A,See how it's kind of starting to go a little more translucent.
779.218,781.421,N/A,Oh and it's not quite as open.
781.621,783.384,N/A,It doesn't have those ruffly edges.
783.725,784.065,N/A,Right.
785.388,786.109,N/A,Cool.
786.129,794.222,N/A,And then we were also asked as you were looking what's one unique thing about this mushroom than other mushrooms you observed.
797.712,801.817,N/A,Where is it growing as grouped together as some?
801.837,808.926,N/A,"Okay, so more individual, not quite as clustered."
809.006,815.214,N/A,Isn't this a small cluster right here of them?
816.475,817.296,N/A,You may pass.
817.396,822.543,N/A,That's where I discovered them.
822.683,825.306,N/A,They look thinner too.
825.826,828.39,N/A,"Well, looks like they're small clusters, though, like here."
828.41,828.951,N/A,Yeah.
829.211,829.471,N/A,Mm hmm.
829.591,833.257,N/A,Fascinating.
833.397,834.058,N/A,Thank you all.
834.138,835.059,N/A,Thank you for the lesson.
841.649,844.073,N/A,"So that was checkpoint, I think, three or four."
844.093,845.775,N/A,I'm starting to lose count.
846.228,846.989,N/A,but it's all good.
847.089,867.711,N/A,"But we just learned about some mushrooms and the stages at what, uh, what they're in stage one, stage two or stage three and how they look at each stage, which is very interesting and mind boggling at the same time."
867.731,869.834,N/A,"Ooh, look all the campground down there."
871.015,872.016,N/A,That's what that is.
875.54,883.371,N/A,"There's a campground down there, it looks like, where you can put a tent up and enjoy safely, of course."
885.194,887.317,N/A,"Oh, let me catch up."
901.156,901.497,N/A,"All right, y'all."
901.517,901.637,N/A,Hello.
901.657,901.777,N/A,Hello.
901.797,901.917,N/A,Hello.
901.937,902.458,N/A,Your station in this city.
904.565,933.508,N/A,you are going to be sharing with lots of ferns around you're going to be sharing about this particular fern right here if you already know it hold it hold your tongue um what do you all notice about this fern there's some here you can look at it you can feel it pay particular attention to the shape that's a different one that's the kind that she's looking at right there
934.13,934.951,N/A,See the difference here?
935.411,935.812,N/A,I do.
937.934,949.306,N/A,"If you were a scientist and you were already given a scientific name but you were charged with giving it a common name, what would you name this fern and why?"
955.453,959.056,N/A,I might name it something having to do with a comb because it looks like a comb to me.
959.517,962.5,N/A,"Okay, the comb fern."
962.969,990.85,N/A,um it almost looks like a tree like some of the shapes it is something like a tree i don't know what its actual common name is given to by some random person so the actual common name of this fern is the christmas fern so on to your point some people are like oh it looks like a christmas tree yeah another reason i've heard is that if you turn the fern horizontally
