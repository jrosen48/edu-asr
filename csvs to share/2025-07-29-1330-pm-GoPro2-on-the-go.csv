1.482,3.103,N/A,It wasn't on.
3.124,3.904,N/A,Mine did the same thing.
3.985,4.665,N/A,It wasn't on.
5.466,6.608,N/A,Mine did the same thing.
6.668,7.789,N/A,So what is yours doing?
8.43,9.812,N/A,Because his might not have as much battery.
10.452,12.475,N/A,"No, his was on."
12.595,13.416,N/A,The screen will go out.
13.436,17.961,N/A,Welcome back y'all to this other side of the valley.
18.061,22.747,N/A,The West Farm Trail yesterday we had the chance to explore towards the cemetery.
22.767,26.832,N/A,"We're going to end at the cemetery today, but we'll do a little loop on our hike."
27.588,49.843,N/A,and during our little hike we are going to have the chance to put on our learner hat one more time and practice a strategy and activity that we love here that also we've heard from a lot of educators is really applicable across grade levels and content areas and we've heard lots of creative ways that this is being used.
49.863,52.988,N/A,It's an activity called beach to teach to
53.407,68.706,N/A,"And this morning I was really thinking about Eat, Shoe, Teach, Shoe when John read the quote at breakfast by Rachel Carson where she talks about how knowing is not half as important as loving."
69.988,78.418,N/A,"And Eat, Shoe, Teach, Shoe gives us the space to really love and connect with this place or the place where you find yourself in."
79.242,83.89,N/A,and it gives you that chance to connect and maybe in a little bit new or different way.
83.91,94.768,N/A,"Yesterday we connected with salamanders and salamanders are so cute and they have the littlest, tidiest toes and sometimes little black toe paths and like it's like love at first sight with a salamander."
94.788,104.524,N/A,But when you're in the woods or you're in your neighborhood or you're in a park we might not connect with everything as quickly or as deeply as the face or the toes of a salamander.
105.297,115.717,N/A,"but East Shoe Teeshoe gives us a lens to start to think about that connection, to see our place in maybe a little bit different way."
115.737,123.031,N/A,"And oftentimes when we are doing science, we think about the so what."
123.973,127.66,N/A,"We're just a welcome home committee, that's why."
130.964,140.837,N/A,She says she's a retired teacher.
141.057,156.837,N/A,I don't think when I during the time I was here.
156.817,158.4,N/A,How's the pension?
158.42,162.028,N/A,"3rd, 4th, 7th."
162.068,165.175,N/A,All of the above.
165.235,167.36,N/A,Mostly science.
168.382,170.246,N/A,"Science, STEM."
170.286,176.58,N/A,There is no pension.
181.049,196.435,N/A,More teachers!
200.362,201.724,N/A,Yes.
201.704,212.68,N/A,"So oftentimes this week we are really focused on data collection, thinking about this probabilistic thinking and revising our thinking, collecting more data, adding to the story."
213.321,218.368,N/A,And oftentimes we wait till the end of that process to think about the so what behind it.
218.388,220.812,N/A,"So what, why are we even studying this?"
220.832,230.766,N/A,But making these connections helps us put that so what at the beginning to help frame and connect us to the work throughout the process instead of just at the end.
231.809,234.073,N/A,So here's how each two teach to is going to work.
234.534,241.045,N/A,In just a minute we will all together as a group hike up to that junction where yesterday we veered off to the right up to the cemetery.
241.866,251.202,N/A,The whole group is going to stay put at that spot and I as a lonesome hiker is going to head up the trail for a little bit.
251.182,254.387,N/A,"And as I am hiking, I'm going to be looking for something cool."
254.847,262.658,N/A,"It could be a species, it could be a medicinal plant, it could be connecting with the sounds around us, it could be artistic."
263.439,268.427,N/A,Something that stands out to me in the trail in that space.
268.447,279.282,N/A,"And after about two-ish minutes, Grayson is going to send the first two people up the trail."
280.325,284.712,N/A,"And those first partners, their job is to hike until you find me."
285.773,296.309,N/A,"When you find me, I am going to teach you about whatever thing I stopped to look at or connect with, and then that becomes your station."
296.329,305.944,N/A,"So then you and your partners stay put there, and you will then teach the subsequent partners whatever that thing was as they come through."
306.599,317.467,N/A,"You are all teachers, so whatever I teach you is one way to say it, but you might have a way to add to it, to give it a little flair, add a little creativity."
317.909,322.701,N/A,So the way that you deliver and share that thing is up to you and your partner.
324.487,350.005,N/A,after did you want to say okay no i'm modeling the sleeves okay so after about two more minutes Grayson will send the next pair that pair will hike up the trail until they find the first pair they will stop at that first pair and learn whatever the fact is from that pair that first pair will stay put the second pair keeps hiking until they find it
350.575,353.419,N/A,And then I will teach them something at that spot.
353.86,355.963,N/A,That will become their station.
356.424,357.185,N/A,They make it their own.
357.225,358.427,N/A,Think about how they want to share it.
358.788,359.529,N/A,They stay put.
359.629,360.31,N/A,I keep hiking.
360.731,363.455,N/A,"Two minutes later, Grayson sends the third pair."
364.056,366.74,N/A,That third pair stops at the first pair and learns.
367.241,369.044,N/A,Stops at the second pair and learns.
369.264,370.787,N/A,Keeps hiking until they find me.
371.347,372.649,N/A,I will teach them something.
372.77,376.075,N/A,This might be a really bad game of telephone.
376.095,376.195,N/A,Yeah.
376.175,382.367,N/A,So we are all unzipped along the trail.
383.209,384.491,N/A,Grayson is going to be last.
385.393,390.704,N/A,"So once everybody has their station, she will come to you and you can teach her your thing."
391.185,395.854,N/A,"When you see Grayson, you know that John is done."
396.239,423.715,N/A,after you teach and then she's going to kind of stay put and you will make your way for the stations ahead of you you are then the participant she will then come to the next station they will teach her that they will keep walking the next they will keep walking until we all zip back up into one group at the end where another junction What questions do we have about each student?
425.804,428.327,N/A,"If it doesn't make sense, yeah, that's fine."
428.347,430.81,N/A,It'll be very clear what you need to do one step at a time.
430.83,432.812,N/A,It feels like a gallery wall.
432.832,434.234,N/A,Similar to a gallery wall?
434.254,436.837,N/A,Yep.
436.857,437.098,N/A,All right.
437.738,442.644,N/A,"So as I said in my instructions, and as the name implies, you do need a partner for this activity."
442.664,446.509,N/A,"So if you'll take a moment, find one other person to work with."
446.529,448.812,N/A,"And if we are odd, we are all odds."
449.933,453.938,N/A,"But if we are unodd, then we could have a one group."
454.61,457.459,N/A,So give your partner a high five when you've got them.
460.969,466.847,N/A,That was awkward.
467.452,474.041,N/A,Everybody is partnered?
474.142,474.983,N/A,It was his camera.

516.876,523.547,N/A,They're all going at the same time.
523.527,530.458,N/A,"If we shared this with our school group, then we got it all wrong."
530.478,538.03,N/A,"It's like as we went along, the person at the station would tell us that all of the people knew the next one."
538.05,541.976,N/A,Then we'd pick that person and they'd tell us about it.
541.996,544.54,N/A,And we like walked in the last circle.
