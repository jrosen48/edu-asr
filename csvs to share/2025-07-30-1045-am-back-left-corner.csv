7.439,31.118,N/A,And then you're going to find the Simpsons biodiversity PowerPoint.
36.565,39.489,N/A,Simpson's diversity numbers.
49.805,61.282,N/A,"If you don't have your packet, that's okay, but we'll definitely need the data, okay?"
63.205,64.767,N/A,So as you struggle to get to
80.305,89.804,N/A,"All right, so the things you need open are just your data from yesterday when we were out doing the hula hoops and then these slides."
90.726,92.009,N/A,And then we're going to open one more thing.
96.057,98.923,N/A,How are we calculating the moths?
98.943,101.588,N/A,"That's going to be a whole different story, so we'll wait to get there."
141.73,156.887,N/A,But as long as you're in these slides and you can see this is slide 24 once you get in there So you can go all the way down to slide 24 and you'll be on the same page as us
186.938,195.177,N/A,"OK, so before we put input data, I need to give you guys group numbers, because we don't have any group numbers."
207.61,210.075,N/A,So let me show you all this real quick.
210.095,211.418,N/A,So here we have aquatic.
212.099,214.084,N/A,And then this is our data from yesterday.
214.124,217.29,N/A,"Remember, the fifth one was unique because it was runoff data."
217.31,219.675,N/A,It wasn't from the actual river stream.
219.976,222.341,N/A,"But instead, it was from the puddle that came from."
222.361,228.454,N/A,"So if you want to analyze that data later, just remember that this is just a little bit unique."
229.598,236.149,N/A,"So if you wanted to compare five and two, maybe in when you do your data presentation, I guess I'm giving you a preview of what you're going to be doing."
236.67,242.019,N/A,"After we input all the data, we're going to split up into middle school groups and high school groups."
242.86,247.648,N/A,And the middle school group is going to kind of have like a little work session as a group.
247.768,249.952,N/A,And the high school group is going to have a little work session as a group.
250.332,251.534,N/A,And then we're going to have partners.
251.675,254.419,N/A,And you're going to pick whatever data you want to analyze.
254.74,256.062,N/A,It doesn't matter.
256.042,258.127,N/A,whatever data you want to analyze.
258.729,261.676,N/A,"And so I'll show you guys some of those expectations in just a second, okay?"
261.897,268.954,N/A,"So it's really just one thing we wanted to make sure we did today, and I know we're all tired and this is probably not the funnest part, but"
269.322,276.312,N/A,"A lot of times when we go to PDs, we hit all those beginning things, like, ooh, great activity, ooh, great activity, but you didn't get to the end."
276.713,285.045,N/A,"So we really wanted to make sure today that we got to the part of inputting the data, creating something with the data to make sure we've done that whole cycle."
285.746,292.596,N/A,"A lot of us, it's a race now, but at the beginning, we asked y'all, how do you collect data?"
298.027,302.552,N/A,"room could say a way that they've collected data, but maybe not a way that they've"
305.182,305.903,N/A,based on the data.
305.923,311.189,N/A,So it was really important to us that we took the time to model that for you all so you could take that back to your classrooms.
311.209,311.529,N/A,Beautiful.
311.569,316.996,N/A,And that's why we decided to switch to middle school and high school because we'll be doing things at different levels.
317.056,320.6,N/A,So we don't need to all go through the math.
322.682,324.765,N/A,"So before we go, let's go through some expectations."
324.785,328.489,N/A,But let's go put the data in first.
330.123,331.888,N/A,"Megan, who is your partner?"
331.928,332.51,N/A,Justin?
332.751,333.433,N/A,"OK, you guys are one."
333.994,335.258,N/A,Who is your partner?
335.358,336.341,N/A,You weren't feeling well.
336.361,336.722,N/A,That's OK.
337.023,337.685,N/A,Who is your partner?
338.788,343.442,N/A,"OK, you guys are number two."
343.742,344.424,N/A,We were together.
345.287,345.347,N/A,OK.
345.53,353.667,N/A,"Okay, so here we go."
353.707,359.56,N/A,You guys are still one.
359.961,360.542,N/A,You guys are two.
360.742,362.065,N/A,"Okay, Vincent, y'all are two."
362.726,363.488,N/A,You guys are three.
378.335,381.4,N/A,"All you do, you can see your first number."
381.84,383.223,N/A,"You can see eight through, right?"
383.283,385.166,N/A,Is everyone good with putting that in?
385.186,385.546,N/A,Okay.
385.807,390.594,N/A,"Do you want to help out, Drew?"
390.614,391.035,N/A,Okay.
392.437,395.842,N/A,I don't know how it... I loved your water bottle.
396.403,401.291,N/A,"I don't know what... For your story, it wasn't as much a... Yeah, but it went in the water cycle."
401.591,405.237,N/A,"Because it went back into the atmosphere, it infiltrated into the soil."
414.312,417.376,N/A,"I mean, it's math."
417.536,422.902,N/A,So you are going to start coding my alphabet.
422.922,425.785,N/A,Do you want to split it here?
425.966,430.21,N/A,"And I'll do D's, E's, and F's."
430.23,431.372,N/A,You do A's and C's.
431.412,436.157,N/A,"Yes, so you see where it says A and then number in quadrant."
436.237,439.341,N/A,"So do you have a preference, A through C or D through F?"
439.361,440.202,N/A,It doesn't matter.
452.264,454.322,N/A,And to do that so quick.
454.342,457.127,N/A,"I mean, I know you already had the idea, but put that together."
484.934,491.147,N/A,I don't think I've seen these in here unless this is the real right here.
491.187,491.849,N/A,"No, that's good."
491.969,494.795,N/A,It was still talking about that.
494.815,495.837,N/A,That was including.
496.458,498.282,N/A,"Yeah, I know."
498.342,504.495,N/A,Only one B. We're doing this like we would just keep going and just have A through whatever.
508.745,509.266,N/A,It depends.
509.406,511.669,N/A,Biodiversity can mean many things.
511.829,514.893,N/A,It depends on what biodiversity you're talking about.
514.914,521.422,N/A,"Are you talking about biodiversity as far as richness, meaning how many different species?"
521.943,530.094,N/A,"Or are you looking at biodiversity meaning evenness or abundance, how many individuals within that species?"
530.835,537.064,N/A,Because it does you no good to have one individual of eight different species because you won't have
542.967,543.769,N/A,You're good.
544.711,551.947,N/A,Keep going.
551.967,554.192,N/A,I'm just going to ask a couple.
600.443,607.374,N/A,"If you're just looking at your one little hula hoop and not really thinking about the rest of the area, that one might just kind of be an outlier, maybe."
607.434,611.079,N/A,"So when you think about the math and stuff in a little bit, think about those ones."
611.099,614.605,N/A,"But also, I like what Michelle said, the thinking about the whole area, too."
614.625,618.471,N/A,"So when you think about the data and whatever you want to analyze, think about that."
618.491,620.694,N/A,So that's there.
620.714,622.637,N/A,We've got that.
625.722,647.663,N/A,kind of worked through this yesterday so if you want to pop in at any point let me know so all right so just wanted to kind of bring back this ABC and then we're really gonna focus on step B when we break up into our separate groups it's really just kind of that data that data point because we've already kind of talked about this cycle so Bayesian if no one
651.878,653.78,N/A,So Josh talked about this.
653.84,654.741,N/A,Jen talked about this.
655.702,659.825,N/A,So you start off with your research question and your initial response.
660.826,662.728,N/A,So the A is account for what you know.
663.149,664.31,N/A,So what do you already know?
664.33,666.532,N/A,What is your initial response to the research question?
666.772,668.734,N/A,What was our original research question for Tremont?
669.815,672.918,N/A,Is it healthy or how healthy is it?
672.938,673.498,N/A,So either way.
674.92,676.061,N/A,So your initial response.
676.081,678.443,N/A,So let's all think back to our initial response.
683.232,686.335,N/A,"we're going to take that data, and we're really going to focus on that data."
686.676,691.721,N/A,"And then when you make your little slide or whatever, we're still going to think about this confidence."
691.961,694.784,N/A,Do you still feel as confident as your initial response?
694.804,696.506,N/A,Would you feel as confident as your initial response?
696.526,699.729,N/A,"So Audrey, talk about when you guys go out to the creek a little bit sometimes."
699.749,701.111,N/A,So they think that it's going to be awful.
701.331,705.015,N/A,"Yeah, so we talk a lot about the water cycle in sixth grade."
705.115,710.1,N/A,"And one of the questions we ask the kids before we go out to our local creek, which is Baker Creek."
710.08,712.885,N/A,"Anyone who likes to bike, you may have been there."
713.506,715.609,N/A,It's very touristy.
715.629,719.956,N/A,Lots of people come from around the area to South Knoxville to use our bike trails.
719.976,728.089,N/A,"And the students know this, and they have this assumption when we go out to our creek that it is very dirty because there's a lot of trash in there."
740.827,750.58,N/A,And so it's really shocking to them when we go out and we actually do the water data that water's actually pretty good quality because of the test that Jin did yesterday.
750.6,752.122,N/A,She'll do with our seventh graders.
752.142,757.83,N/A,They're shocked to find out that they were wrong because they're so confident that their school is dusty.
757.85,758.571,N/A,And they see trash.
758.591,761.876,N/A,They see trash and they think pollution means dirty.
761.896,764.058,N/A,They think pollution means plastic specifically.
764.079,766.682,N/A,And they have all these preconceived ideas.
773.294,782.342,N/A,"Okay, so as Justin and a few people just told us, what is the health of the ecosystem in Tremont?"
811.178,814.601,N/A,"And then you mentioned revising that question, perhaps."
814.781,815.902,N/A,"David said a bit of that, too."
815.922,830.855,N/A,"So even though our initial question was how healthy is the ecosystem, if you wanted to revise that and be more focused on how healthy is or how is the biodiversity of the terrestrial ecosystem connected to the health, how is the water quality connected to the health."
830.875,841.084,N/A,"So when you get to your little slide, whatever data you're focusing on, you can kind of revamp that question and then see if your confidence changes when you get back"
841.064,847.395,N/A,your data analysis.
848.118,851.542,N/A,This is Krebs's thoughts through my words.
852.123,858.552,N/A,"So when we work together, I don't know if you've ever seen this, but he goes and you watch his brain work, right?"
858.772,861.796,N/A,"And then I'm like, hold on a second, and I'm like, all right, let's get these thoughts together."
862.156,865.901,N/A,"So if you have any questions, we'll ask for him on this too."
866.141,867.924,N/A,So what's the health of the ecosystem at Streamout?
867.944,868.985,N/A,What's your confidence?
869.005,869.626,N/A,So remember that.
870.467,875.914,N/A,"So before we go break up into our separate groups, we're going to do a little mini activity, and then you're going to do this."
876.181,879.389,N/A,Get with a partner and analyze your choice of data using one of the analysis tools.
879.45,880.893,N/A,We're just going to do Google Sheets or Kodak.
881.074,882.457,N/A,Let's not jump into data classroom.
883.219,884.082,N/A,It just does.
884.102,885.947,N/A,That's the complexity and everything.
885.967,888.192,N/A,"It's not hard, but you know what I mean."
888.212,890.96,N/A,You're going to create a product of whatever data you want.
891.361,892.283,N/A,If you want to compare two plots.
894.136,898.783,N/A,aquatic runoff and the stream.
898.964,900.226,N/A,It's literally your world.
900.266,906.736,N/A,"If you want to compare all of the plots and put them all on a graph and see whatever you want to do, it's your world, okay?"
907.878,910.141,N/A,So create a product of whatever data you want.
910.882,914.248,N/A,Process it into a graph and write some sort of a conclusion.
914.728,915.409,N/A,What do you see?
915.55,916.251,N/A,What do you notice?
916.271,917.713,N/A,What trends are observed?
925.81,933.512,N/A,"I even if it's not formally done on the slide, I still want you guys, so like this is your creative product and it's going to be on the slides."
933.533,939.55,N/A,"I'll show you just saying if you are able to, I really want you to either write out a rubric of what you"
944.356,948.865,N/A,of what you did and see if you wanted to enhance that a little bit more.
949.205,950.909,N/A,So that's something super important to him.
951.971,954.375,N/A,So hopefully we'll be able to do all that as well.
954.997,956.359,N/A,But it's also our comfort zone.
956.379,961.189,N/A,"If some of us, it takes longer to do data analysis and produce graphs and come to a conclusion, that's OK."
961.87,965.537,N/A,"So just know at the end, we're all going to be"
965.517,971.087,N/A,presenting these little presentations and it's just like as artifacts to kind of show where we're all at.
971.107,983.089,N/A,"Okay, so we're all at different levels and that's kind of the point of this activity is to kind of see like, hey, this person did really good with the graphing, but you know, it was simple data or more complex data, but the graph didn't make any sense, right?"
983.389,987.677,N/A,"Okay, and then we'll compare and present your financial"
995.15,1002.797,N/A,We can use either aquatic or terrestrial we don't have to do
1026.132,1027.589,N/A,That's fine too.
1028.074,1029.612,N/A,If you have time to accomplish...
1099.353,1101.864,N/A,Audrey's like the next step.
1101.945,1106.545,N/A,"So after you have all this data like, hey, we could go clean it up."
1190.782,1194.025,N/A,measurable or there's no way that you can test it.
1229.02,1249.662,N/A,"bit about some comparative water resources, water quality."
1280.607,1282.483,N/A,you could use with your students if you're.
1313.598,1318.984,N/A,Can you show me really quickly how to change it from a dot?
1331.587,1346.878,N/A,if I have multiple data sets that I'm looking at in one location like we have on our terrestrial right you know so we've got group one has these species right so if you want to keep group one together and then see group twos together and then
1367.243,1370.288,N/A,"I didn't realize it was a. Oh, it doesn't."
1370.308,1371.129,N/A,This is me.
1371.289,1371.77,N/A,"Oh, that's you."
1371.79,1373.553,N/A,"OK, we did the exact same thing."
1373.613,1375.396,N/A,"So I was like, did I do that?"
1375.576,1379.723,N/A,Can you show me what it looks like if they've fused that option you had over there?
1379.743,1382.367,N/A,Please.
1382.387,1383.228,N/A,There we go.
1383.248,1384.27,N/A,"Yeah, but then it doesn't."
1384.29,1386.113,N/A,You had a green outlier in the middle.
1389.164,1411.56,N/A,I was visualizing a little more when David had his presentation up where he had multiple dots and then a bar like percentage
1414.763,1431.658,N/A,There's a mean it'll give you a middle but it won't give you like the confidence
1457.035,1458.912,N/A,"Okay, I was just curious."
1604.185,1616.001,N/A,And then it was slide 24.
1640.315,1652.788,N/A,I'm gonna say
1696.812,1702.89,N/A,"Personally, I'm taking the high school kids downstairs."
1702.91,1703.091,N/A,It's hot.
1703.111,1703.413,N/A,"Yeah, it's hot."
1763.89,1768.129,N/A,We're okay.
