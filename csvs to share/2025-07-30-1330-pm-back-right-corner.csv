0.031,22.102,N/A,That's a really fun connection.
22.162,23.384,N/A,That's a good idea.
23.905,25.667,N/A,"So yeah, but at a minimum,"
31.823,53.533,N/A,We're going to make them worth your while.
53.573,60.042,N/A,"We're also going to have one hour Zoom meetings August, October,"
61.186,63.869,N/A,"early December, January, March, April."
63.889,65.731,N/A,"So it sounds like a lot, but there'll be an hour."
66.092,67.753,N/A,"If you can't make them, we will record them."
67.954,70.517,N/A,"These are going to be a little bit, we again hope you can join."
71.297,73.68,N/A,"We can troubleshoot, answer questions about what's going on."
73.84,75.783,N/A,We can just be resources for you and be a community.
76.383,80.428,N/A,We might read parts of ambitious science teaching and check in on these.
80.608,85.894,N/A,"Those are gonna be less strictly important, but we really hope you can join and we'll ask you to join if you're able."
86.127,89.656,N/A,And we'll send out a email to schedule those soon.
89.696,90.598,N/A,That's going to be tough again.
90.618,95.31,N/A,"We know some of you are not just, yeah, you coach, you have family life, you have others you're caring for, we get it."
96.653,97.916,N/A,So we'll try our best on those two.
98.438,101.064,N/A,"So that way, we're hoping this is a balance of we don't want to be a burden."
101.084,103.41,N/A,We know how busy you are as teachers.
114.916,116.438,N/A,"Oh, and then we'll have a celebration at the end."
116.478,117.659,N/A,Maybe more ice cream.
117.879,143.927,N/A,"All right, double the ice cream."
144.616,146.558,N/A,"Oh, is that after D-Day?"
146.918,149.641,N/A,"Okay, very good."
149.661,157.57,N/A,"Okay, email, you know, we all get, I know you all probably get a hundred emails a day."
159.372,160.273,N/A,How can we stay in touch?
160.473,163.276,N/A,So text messages is out of the question just because there's so many of us.
163.416,164.517,N/A,That's just too big.
165.278,171.805,N/A,"Options include Slack, RipMe, Teams,"
175.025,190.664,N/A,I'm hearing several groupies percolating up.
192.526,197.572,N/A,Any other thoughts on GroupMe?
197.932,199.294,N/A,You'll download it.
211.61,214.474,N/A,I think it'd be nice to be able to have kind of a back channel.
214.494,218.88,N/A,"When you're just not at your email, you have a quick question, you're running late to the PD."
219.861,223.205,N/A,I'm trying to think of something funny that you missed.
223.225,224.687,N/A,Or you just want to share something.
224.707,226.77,N/A,You just want to share something.
226.79,227.371,N/A,"OK, there you go."
227.391,231.796,N/A,"Just checking in on the, yeah."
231.897,236.082,N/A,You found a cool first person salamander capturing video on GoPro that reminded you of Tom's.
239.352,259.588,N/A,up and this is probably the kind of thing where we'll need to kind of remind each other about using it and you know if hopefully it's useful to at least most of us it's probably not going to be used by all of us hopefully we'll use this as a tool and of course you can always you can always email and if we have trouble getting in touch maybe we can meet one-on-one and just find a way that works
268.883,275.069,N/A,and then we'll send that out to everybody and maybe we can use that first Zoom meeting just to make sure if you have any questions that everyone's joined and work that out.
275.97,282.596,N/A,"All right, let's, we're gonna come back to this in just a second, sorry."
284.058,285.739,N/A,"Oh, heavy, heavy things."
285.759,287.982,N/A,"Okay, last thing, last big thing here to talk through."
288.562,289.803,N/A,So this is a research project.
293.447,295.088,N/A,This is an important part of the project.
295.128,298.772,N/A,Amanda said this nicely earlier to some of you that this is a big part of us
301.672,309.043,N/A,"more funding for this work in the future, for sharing what we found with others, kind of getting the most bang for the buck in the project."
309.063,312.468,N/A,So some of you have already done this from last year.
312.568,313.99,N/A,So here's the gist.
314.731,325.907,N/A,"To do research in Knox County schools, you need district approval, which we have received from the, what is it, REA, Research, Evaluation, and Assessment Office in Knox County."
340.096,348.808,N/A,"What we would need, though, to do research with your students, which we hope to do, I'll say more about how and why in a moment, is the approval of your principal."
349.289,351.472,N/A,"I have checked several times, and that does not need to be in writing."
351.492,353.495,N/A,"It just needs to, it's almost important."
353.515,354.697,N/A,"You can ask them in the hallway, even."
355.157,356.299,N/A,We don't need to submit that to IRB.
356.319,357.981,N/A,We don't need to submit that to next time.
358.001,359.584,N/A,But it's just.
361.226,364.631,N/A,"But if they find out you're testing on their students, and they didn't know about it."
364.731,365.232,N/A,Exactly.
365.292,366.554,N/A,I think that's where we run into trouble.
366.574,369.698,N/A,"So maybe having something in writing, maybe email would be best practice."
375.837,386.701,N/A,"If you are concerned about that at all, let me know, and we can give you materials, e-mails, language around that to go through that process."
386.841,391.872,N/A,"Or if you just want to talk about it, let me know."
416.641,417.848,N/A,just a link to a survey.
418.411,418.834,N/A,What's your name?
418.874,419.598,N/A,What's your student's name?
419.92,421.268,N/A,I agree.
446.257,456.891,N/A,we I love that idea which we could do that because of our internal review board process which is really rigorous that could
