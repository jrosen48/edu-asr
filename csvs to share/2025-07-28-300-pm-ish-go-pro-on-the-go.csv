0.284,1.065,N/A,clean it up.
1.345,4.909,N/A,And we could go to a lab too.
5.149,5.65,N/A,A lobby.
5.83,6.851,N/A,We just went and took over.
7.151,20.185,N/A,But that's a place where I was curious about using just trying a different rather than sheets but after playing with it sheets is what I prefer to use than Kodak for that assignment.
21.346,24.469,N/A,But we had also talked about
25.512,32.923,N/A,There's a lab measuring albedo effect and you go around campus and you lay out a thermometer and you do
33.562,44.397,N/A,"an asphalt surface versus, say, a tennis court versus grass versus asphalt in the shade, asphalt in the sun, grass in the shade, grass in the sun."
44.417,45.178,N/A,I'm jumping on that.
45.198,45.719,N/A,I like that.
46.1,46.921,N/A,But I've not done that.
46.941,55.333,N/A,"I teach, I say albedo, but I teach albedo a lot for my year ones and my year twos."
56.094,62.843,N/A,And we even talk about like skin colors and all of that with albedo and like what color shirt you're going to wear.
63.38,64.761,N/A,That's definitely a micro-regulum.
64.841,66.243,N/A,"Yeah, we practiced it."
66.423,70.246,N/A,"Well, we use with mercury thermometers the way that the lab that we do."
70.487,71.528,N/A,"Well, it's not really mercury."
71.548,72.669,N/A,It's the fake red stuff.
73.069,74.911,N/A,"Well, the fake."
74.931,75.031,N/A,Yeah.
75.051,75.551,N/A,The glass ones.
75.611,76.412,N/A,Imitation mercury.
76.432,78.714,N/A,Because you have to put them on a ruler.
78.734,79.575,N/A,So tell me more.
80.296,87.603,N/A,"So you got a ruler, and you put the bottom of the thermometer about one inch, like one inch from the bottom, tape it to the ruler."
88.163,90.766,N/A,And you have to have them stand there for an X amount of time.
90.926,91.286,N/A,I gotcha.
91.306,93.268,N/A,So they read the thermometer before.
93.67,95.072,N/A,And they read the thermometer after.
95.112,99.639,N/A,And then they record the results and see the temperature difference.
99.819,103.404,N/A,"And then they reset the thermometer, essentially, and then they go do a different surface."
103.625,103.865,N/A,Love it.
103.885,106.509,N/A,Do you put it on the ruler so that there's the same amount?
106.589,108.552,N/A,"So it's not touching the surface, so it's a bright above it."
108.572,109.774,N/A,And then there's the same amount?
109.834,113.078,N/A,"Do you get that specific, like, a half an inch above the ground or whatever?"
113.098,113.9,N/A,It's an inch.
113.92,115.262,N/A,"It's like, we do an inch."
115.923,118.046,N/A,"Yeah, the write-up for it says an inch."
118.066,119.027,N/A,So that's what we do.
119.308,121.15,N/A,How do you prop it?
121.491,123.053,N/A,Just tape it to the ruler.
123.961,125.143,N/A,Cause the ruler doesn't matter.
125.183,126.705,N/A,The ruler's only there.
127.026,129.55,N/A,You just literally hold it straight up and down.
129.57,131.473,N/A,"Oh, so you just stand there and wait with it."
131.493,131.673,N/A,Yep.
131.693,134.898,N/A,"It's got a timer, somebody holding the thermometer, somebody collecting the data."
135.219,135.539,N/A,Okay.
135.579,135.8,N/A,Sorry.
135.82,136.341,N/A,I was thinking.
136.421,139.325,N/A,I was kind of thinking they were sitting there.
139.646,144.093,N/A,"Yeah, that's it."
144.233,148.299,N/A,That's where I was.
148.339,150.002,N/A,And then they carry around a little.
149.982,158.227,N/A,glass of water so if you need to cool it down really quick you can get the monger in the water get it back to just it's really easy.
158.448,163.283,N/A,Our kids love to go to the rooftop because we have white and black rooftops.
163.803,172.03,N/A,"Yeah, but what I like about it is if we could do this towards the beginning, you can tie that in with positive feedback loops."
172.05,172.671,N/A,"I knew that too, yeah."
172.771,181.598,N/A,You can tie that in with energy uses and urban heat island versus having green space within a city and why you want green space.
181.879,184.381,N/A,One of my new units this year is urban planning.
184.401,192.628,N/A,"Okay, but I mean there are so many, there are multiple places throughout the semester where we could tie in"
192.659,194.862,N/A,"Oh, you remember when we went out and did that experiment?"
194.882,195.202,N/A,Yeah.
195.222,196.283,N/A,"Well, what did you find out?"
196.323,199.787,N/A,What do you remember about having a white roof versus a black roof?
199.807,201.369,N/A,We could pull the graphs too.
201.389,206.735,N/A,"And yeah, you could tie it in with passive solar design or active solar design."
206.755,213.283,N/A,"And I mean, there are just so many places with that you could use that data set repeatedly."
213.303,213.443,N/A,Yeah.
214.785,215.145,N/A,I don't know.
215.205,216.727,N/A,That was something we had talked about.
217.328,218.969,N/A,And the kids like just getting outside.
218.989,219.75,N/A,"No, I'm down."
219.951,220.131,N/A,Yeah.
220.591,221.232,N/A,I like that a lot.
222.055,229.008,N/A,The only other two places I use any kind of graphing is we count cars and do biodiversity.
229.929,235.66,N/A,Shannon Wiener index with evenness and species richness and I have the formula and they fill out the google sheets.
236.011,243.064,N/A,"between a staff and student parking lot and then Yeah, most of our students will have much nicer cars."
243.124,247.272,N/A,"Well, I actually had a student last in the spring Yours will be even more so."
247.433,247.593,N/A,Ms.
247.633,250.078,N/A,"Wilder, why are there more BMWs in the student lot?"
250.098,251.761,N/A,I said that's a great question.
252.041,254.526,N/A,I don't know.
254.506,269.724,N/A,"So I do data with that as well, but we just and the lesson I'm doing tomorrow is Simpson's diversity index and It's measuring biodiversity in a plot of land So you probably will all be able to use that."
269.824,281.357,N/A,"Yeah, I think I got a quadrant as well Yeah, we're gonna do cars because they're easier to identify but this is the way like if you yeah, yeah field you would do it nice and then"
282.232,289.103,N/A,The only other one is I do the college board salinity lab with the with the radish seeds.
289.123,305.269,N/A,We were talking about that on the driving up here because we wrote up together about with agriculture doing just some sort of an experiment where maybe they change what fertilizer is added not adding a fertilizer.
305.84,310.848,N/A,growing it in our window under natural light versus LED grow lights.
311.729,314.914,N/A,"Just, you know, adding variables here and there just to see what happens."
317.117,327.774,N/A,"And incorporate that in a little bit with... Another place I gather data, we build mesocosms and then they have to gather data about the growth."
328.034,329.316,N/A,So it's like a terrarium.
330.157,331.779,N/A,"You don't know, but it's like a terrarium."
332.4,338.489,N/A,And they have to have the different layers of soil so they can measure soil moisture.
338.569,341.332,N/A,"I have these, I can't remember what they're called."
341.373,347.02,N/A,"I'm not very good at words, but agrometers, the things that you can put in there that tell the temperature and the humidity."
347.341,350.665,N/A,So they're recording that kind of data and then have to do graphs and stuff from that.
350.946,359.758,N/A,"And then I do, with my seniors, soil carbon analysis."
360.008,366.056,N/A,"Do you do permeability, density, porosity, water holding capacity?"
366.076,368.219,N/A,"Yeah, I do all that in soil."
368.299,376.05,N/A,So that's more data that we collect as we compare it against clay versus sand versus a random sample from the schoolyard?
376.11,383.4,N/A,"Yeah, I do a lab with percolation rates and infiltration rates."
384.005,388.412,N/A,"Um, I just remember I do a salt oxygen one with the aquatic plants."
388.993,389.373,N/A,"Oh, nice."
389.453,389.774,N/A,Yeah.
389.994,390.956,N/A,I could do something like that.
390.976,399.248,N/A,"Where they start with a, like before the plant and then they're sealed off and dark so that, so there's one without plants, one with plants."
400.871,403.134,N/A,"And, oh, I think a dark and a light bottle."
403.735,408.282,N/A,So they check the dissolved oxygen of the dark versus the light showing photosynthesis.
408.602,409.824,N/A,Like a Vernier probe?
410.044,410.225,N/A,Yeah.
410.665,411.767,N/A,Do you guys have Vernier probes?
413.165,414.588,N/A,Chemistry does.
414.608,420.338,N/A,We can probably borrow them.
421.3,422.703,N/A,"Yeah, I was just curious."
422.783,424.807,N/A,"Yeah, chemistry uses them."
425.769,427.472,N/A,It might not have dissolved oxygen though.
427.572,429.516,N/A,It's its own probe.
429.816,431.8,N/A,I know occasionally we collect data.
431.84,432.962,N/A,We have
434.208,442.86,N/A,"the little water quality dip sticks that have like 16 readings and we collect water, we'll do fecal coliform measurements."
443.701,443.982,N/A,Nice.
444.002,446.104,N/A,With the dip sticks for fecal coliform?
446.125,449.169,N/A,"No, that's separate, but that's part of the water quality."
449.95,452.033,N/A,It's a separate little experiment.
452.313,455.878,N/A,And of course we test fish aquariums versus
