38.101,65.222,N/A,"Feel a little weird, but we can do it Forest trees last part Positive behaviors only see here's a trail up here that we're not going on but"
66.62,82.789,N/A,it is very far up you can see some of the forestry on the left you see tree trunks the roots of trees that have fallen you see fungus
83.866,85.328,N/A,that have grown on tree limbs.
85.748,90.494,N/A,"You see other fallen trees, mushrooms, things of that sort."
92.116,100.706,N/A,See the crew down here as they get themselves prepared for the adventure of hiking this wonderful trail.
101.868,104.451,N/A,"We're going in groups of twos, as you may have heard."
104.511,108.556,N/A,"Reach one, teach one, I believe is what it's called."
109.697,113.822,N/A,"And as we do that, we will be learning from each other."
114.629,118.747,N/A,and also using our teaching skills to instruct each other.
119.009,120.998,N/A,And that is the tutorial.
122.143,124.453,N/A,Probably everything for this video you can probably...
124.99,129.174,N/A,"Yeah, you can edit it out or you can keep it."
129.214,137.342,N/A,"But we are definitely going to have a fantastic time, even though that's not an educational word to use."
138.063,140.725,N/A,But we are currently in waiting.
141.726,148.393,N/A,"So we're going to look around at some of the shrubbery, the forestry that we are in."
149.474,152.837,N/A,"This trail right here, of course, is well traveled."
153.762,156.605,N/A,I'm not there by myself because it is not smart.
158.326,160.268,N/A,And we see a spider web right here.
161.149,167.775,N/A,"Do not know what kind of spider that is, but I will not get close enough to find out because it is not healthy for a human."
168.876,172.459,N/A,We're going to back away and we're going to walk back down.
174.08,174.681,N/A,"Oh, never mind."
174.701,175.342,N/A,We're going to stop here.
175.402,176.663,N/A,You see the algae on this tree?
177.924,181.407,N/A,It is nice or fungus or both.
182.669,183.83,N/A,Could be a mix of both.
184.511,189.295,N/A,"I believe those are mushrooms, some of that sort."
190.196,192.418,N/A,"Not mushrooms, but more probably fungus and whatnot."
195.501,211.495,N/A,"So yeah, we're gonna walk back down to the bottom and show this huge park that we are engulfed in."
211.88,217.005,N/A,and to share with all of you who are gonna be watching the video.
217.045,219.647,N/A,So I will be back in a moment.
219.887,220.848,N/A,"Oh, nevermind, scratch that."
220.868,221.549,N/A,I'm gonna stay on.
222.39,226.033,N/A,So I wanna go up a little more just because our team has not been called yet.
227.014,228.715,N/A,You see lots of forms of grass.
229.956,239.305,N/A,"You see lots of vegetation that is growing about this forest, which,"
239.707,243.234,N/A,"is why they call the Great Smoky Forest or Great Smoky Mountains, rather."
244.075,254.454,N/A,Excuse my miss timing or miss naming it or misguiding the name I quoted.
255.376,256.939,N/A,But here we are.
257.712,261.677,N/A,So I'm going to stop here because I don't want to get lost in the forest.
262.358,270.329,N/A,"But as we see, we have our other cohort on the film down below named Alicia."
271.17,277.799,N/A,And then we see that the rocks up here as part of the trail that we'll be walking.
279.301,280.703,N/A,I don't want to get too far to touch.
281.785,285.61,N/A,So I'm going to go about right here where we have
287.817,293.465,N/A,"Of course, the tree trunk has been uprooted, most likely by storm or just nature."
294.607,312.954,N/A,"As you can see, you can see how the roots have started turning into a different vegetation now that has been toppled, which means for the looks of it's toppled a long time ago."
312.994,316.339,N/A,"And with that being noted and said,"
317.23,318.432,N/A,it then turns into something else.
318.452,338.462,N/A,"So it like grows, not grows, but it molds itself into nature as it sinks, as it starts to be engulfed in the soil beneath it and becomes a different asset to nature."
343.572,349.119,N/A,"And up here, you see how the trail goes way up there, way up there."
349.38,357.611,N/A,"It kind of has looks like it had like a wood railing to the right, down the camera to the left."
357.631,358.291,N/A,That's pretty cool.
359.233,359.713,N/A,Pretty cool.
360.374,366.502,N/A,Now we'll head back down before my group leaves me because I just may do that.
368.365,369.486,N/A,We don't want that to happen.
371.249,372.33,N/A,I'm going to come back down.
374.386,379.57,N/A,with society and I will reach out to you all shortly.
