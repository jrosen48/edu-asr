60.528,62.531,N/A,all seniors so some of them may be 18.
63.252,79.954,N/A,Yeah I think first of all teaching a research class sounds amazing and the limitations piece I feel like there's so like so many people that could come in and talk to a class about like what that actually looks like to what it means for me to do
99.847,129.82,N/A,I found a whole bunch of them.

302.903,313.748,N/A,"I guarantee, like, David's actually a really good person at just bold emailing professors."
313.768,317.957,N/A,"And they're pretty responsive, right?"
317.977,320.423,N/A,"Biology department, English department, I guarantee."
338.02,340.684,N/A,I don't know if I got them.

651.136,652.811,N/A,You wanna try and see if you can count the toes.
652.851,655.999,N/A,Maybe I'm just vision impaired.

810.446,812.709,N/A,That'd be a blue ridge two-line salamander.
813.269,814.451,N/A,Or if body's reddish.
815.552,817.594,N/A,I don't think it's reddish.

856.049,857.351,N/A,That's where I'm leaning.

872.412,882.366,N/A,"I think there were lines, but I don't know if they're... Okay, let's look at, that's a good idea."

960.959,964.282,N/A,They're tiny and sometimes not visible unless you view the salamander in water.
966.325,981.501,N/A,"So I think ours is a little older because... I feel like that's a two line, because that's those two lines."
981.903,995.463,N/A,"chosen to key it out, then you and your buddy may say farewell to your salamander."
995.483,997.906,N/A,"Now to release your salamander, you're going to take it back to you."

1000.911,1002.493,N/A,I want to make sure you hear this first.
1003.604,1026.27,N/A,release your salamander because it is so important that we get them back in a really safe manner so when you are ready to release even if that's not yet you're going to take your bag and this even though it's holding the ph kit is going to stand in for my bag and i'm going to take my salamander back to the cone before i open the bag so that they you know don't jump out on the way
1026.622,1035.731,N/A,"I'm going to kneel down by the cone, and I'm going to gently invert the bag and shake my salamander loose right next to the cone that's marking the place that I found them."
1035.751,1044.859,N/A,"I am not going to pick up the rock they were under, replace salamander, and then put rock back on top because possible squish."
1044.879,1050.284,N/A,We're going to drop them off at their door and let them go home in their own time.
1050.925,1056.51,N/A,Then you can double check that that bag is empty before you bring the empty bag back to me.
1057.418,1064.404,N/A,"You're going to leave the cone in place, so don't bring the cone back yet."
1064.424,1067.627,N/A,Leave the cone in place.
1067.647,1072.672,N/A,And so that we can take data from it.
1072.692,1075.755,N/A,"So, yes, if you're still sketching or still feeding out, feel free to continue those."
1075.895,1084.843,N/A,"When you're ready, you and your buddy may take your salamander home."
1085.6,1109.953,N/A,"The Blue Ridge, if you agree."
1112.819,1115.682,N/A,"Body yellow is your golden, long and slender, two black stripes."
1117.745,1131.721,N/A,"I don't think it's long and slender yet, but it does have those two black stripes."
