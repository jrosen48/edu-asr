0.605,8.076,N/A,"respond to baking and water, just to see how Rolipolis respond to baking and water."
8.116,13.264,N/A,Do they show preferences there with similarities and differences?
13.284,15.427,N/A,"Yeah, it's going to be bad if they follow the water."
15.447,18.972,N/A,"Well, really, it doesn't really matter."
19.052,20.274,N/A,They just need to follow each other.
20.314,23.158,N/A,And the Rolipolis needs not to.
23.639,24.761,N/A,They don't.
25.021,26.423,N/A,They don't.
26.784,28.266,N/A,They need DGAF.
28.853,30.616,N/A,The termites will follow each other eventually.
30.636,34.222,N/A,Because each one that walks is then reinforcing your pheromone.
37.447,42.035,N/A,"So the more they walk the circle, the more go in that direction."
42.095,43.457,N/A,Now this one's kind of cool.
43.517,53.494,N/A,This one is saying it's talking about using a model to explain a different trait variation.
61.135,63.377,N/A,the genetic information is exactly the same.
63.958,66.841,N/A,Why are living things different from one another?
66.861,69.104,N/A,So definitely the genetics.
70.946,78.314,N/A,"And like we were talking about, we were saying we could do this as like a multi-lesson throughout the year, come back to it."
80.296,86.243,N/A,"Which I like because with each of these, we're supposed to have a driving question board anyways."
87.144,88.425,N/A,So I could try to
104.622,119.374,N/A,I'm just curious how we're going to measure that.
122.172,126.438,N/A,I don't know if you just do that.
126.458,126.679,N/A,Yeah.
126.699,128.421,N/A,But we need lots.
128.621,130.945,N/A,We need things that they can go to.
131.205,133.929,N/A,They're not great researchers.
133.989,134.57,N/A,For genetics?
136.393,142.121,N/A,"For the one that you read that was like, how can we classify a living thing so that they're made of cells?"
142.141,143.383,N/A,So that one would be?
143.403,145.406,N/A,I want to look up this chamber thing.
145.426,146.147,N/A,What's a chamber?
146.187,146.727,N/A,Choice chamber.
147.509,150.593,N/A,There's something you can buy from Carolina really easily.
153.34,153.941,N/A,Link for it.
154.241,155.582,N/A,Link for it.
156.964,157.604,N/A,Yeah.
157.865,160.087,N/A,Pack it and get a pack of 10.
160.127,162.269,N/A,So there's going to be a cell explorer game.
162.329,162.79,N/A,Perfect.
162.81,166.293,N/A,It looks like it's just two Petri digits stuck together.
167.294,168.075,N/A,With a little bridge.
169.737,173.581,N/A,And a little specialized lid so that nothing crawls out.
173.601,175.543,N/A,And filter papers fit real nice in there.
175.563,176.744,N/A,That's what I'm looking for.
176.764,178.145,N/A,Slap it down.
178.746,180.968,N/A,Read a history of classification.
183.462,188.65,N/A,"Yeah, I forget about that sometimes."
189.11,199.986,N/A,Now I get to plant new resources.
200.707,209.76,N/A,"This looks like more of like a... Oh gosh, what is this?"
209.78,210.381,N/A,"Okay, so..."
226.274,245.683,N/A,So instead of doing candy instead of doing candy you could do something really similar to what we did today where you're having to go outside they throw the hula hoop or whatever shape you want and they're
251.519,256.266,N/A,The one you laughed too hard at will come back.
256.306,257.412,N/A,It just kind of felt a little twin.
290.281,300.595,N/A,Read a team rubric for each one.
322.225,326.273,N/A,So you think that the termites will make their way across?
326.293,328.357,N/A,"I mean, if they follow the trail, they will."
328.377,331.243,N/A,"Have you looked at, like, a video of what this looks like?"
331.583,336.954,N/A,"Or you could, like, show the way that the paper did."
336.974,340.521,N/A,"Like, draw a line in the middle, and then draw it to one."
341.294,342.876,N/A,And then drop your termites in the middle.
343.216,345.439,N/A,Do they go to the bic or the non-bic?
345.479,346.44,N/A,Is there a difference?
346.521,347.962,N/A,Is there a substantial difference?
348.163,352.969,N/A,And then do the same deal for the roly polys.
352.989,357.815,N/A,"One side's damp, the other side's dry."
358.115,360.378,N/A,Drop them in the middle.
361.019,366.846,N/A,Do they go left or do they go right?
367.012,386.944,N/A,I think the ink one was coming up next.
401.048,405.475,N/A,"If I really need to, I can be like, have a random thing where it's like, oh my gosh, fine, then it's here's some candy."
406.637,408.54,N/A,That way they know that that's the connection back to it.
409.201,412.385,N/A,"But be like, I'm getting you something a little bit more fun."
412.526,414.489,N/A,"I think from a, I think."
414.509,417.193,N/A,"Following that line pretty well, now that it's founded, isn't it?"
417.253,417.353,N/A,Yeah.
418.548,425.963,N/A,"Well, it looks like this works pretty well."
425.983,427.085,N/A,It worked pretty well in that chamber.
427.105,429.149,N/A,Have you guys never played with the termites?
429.229,429.57,N/A,No.
429.77,432.415,N/A,"See, they've done roly-polies and I've done termites."
432.896,434.74,N/A,I haven't done roly-polies.
434.76,437.926,N/A,I've done roly-polies with my AP students for a couple years.
437.946,439.83,N/A,"Oh, they follow the red too."
439.81,445.398,N/A,"It's Bic, it's just the formula for the ink."
445.478,454.01,N/A,"But if you switch brands on them or use a Sharpie, like they hate the Sharpie, so it's good to use a Sharpie in a Bic."
454.03,457.174,N/A,"That can be an extension experiment, like try another red color."
457.395,461.16,N/A,So you can do it in the observation phase.
461.731,468.157,N/A,Because we want them to ask questions about the roly-polys and the eye spots.
468.258,473.463,N/A,"And the more I thought about it, I liked splitting the class in half, half get termites, half get roly-polys."
473.823,480.009,N/A,"Then they research, and then they jigsaw."
480.149,487.156,N/A,Or you can order from Carolina.
487.197,489.679,N/A,You can also go out and roll over a lot.
489.659,494.905,N/A,"In my experience, natural termites work better."
494.925,497.908,N/A,I'm not sure how to go collect a termite.
497.988,505.997,N/A,"I think Cody's thinking about place-based, but I think the context could also be like learning the background of like."
506.017,507.319,N/A,"Okay, this is weird."
507.339,509.441,N/A,"I'm like planning for a unit, wait for a unit."
509.461,510.502,N/A,And like learning about like.
510.742,513.926,N/A,I've even done part of the research one and two.
513.966,516.389,N/A,"Roly-polys, like evolutionarily pathways, different."
516.569,517.39,N/A,"Of course, right?"
517.41,518.451,N/A,"Yeah, I get that."
522.346,540.304,N/A,"They can communicate, yes, but they're not a communal organism."
540.284,543.087,N/A,"There is a bee connection, but they're hard to work with."
543.107,544.007,N/A,That's so odd.
544.168,545.129,N/A,"He's got some bees, right?"
545.389,545.989,N/A,I have bees as well.
546.009,551.274,N/A,This actually says it's developed and is a hierarchical model of multicellular organisms.
551.354,554.577,N/A,"Bees also communicate, but it's not manipulated."
554.597,558.501,N/A,"I think the bee colony is similar to the termite colony, and I think that's what we want to talk about."
558.821,561.084,N/A,"Yeah, termites are easy to manipulate."
561.504,568.03,N/A,"So where we went was like, we're thinking of like, group behavior."
568.01,583.608,N/A,"And so if we get a bunch of termites and a bunch of roly-polies, put a wet cloth in both, and we draw lines with ink in both chambers, both of them will travel to one end of this chamber we can purchase on Carolina."
583.769,586.031,N/A,"With the ink, I don't know that the roly-polies will."
586.151,587.954,N/A,"What I'm saying is if we put wet, moist."
588.014,591.017,N/A,We're just going to make it equal.
591.037,593.2,N/A,So it will be kind of like a real investigation.
593.44,595.182,N/A,Why is this happening?
595.162,596.104,N/A,They're not the same.
596.244,601.612,N/A,"We do that the same way to communicate, and then we learn about different chemotaxis methods."
603.816,608.083,N/A,"I was just looking through them, actually."
608.143,614.112,N/A,"You know, the NGSS wiped out one section of their stuff."
614.132,615.294,N/A,That was just there.
616.737,618.84,N/A,The Concord Consortium is really good.
619.597,620.178,N/A,It was weird.
620.238,623.281,N/A,"I got that email, but I didn't get the email with the Google form."
623.561,625.223,N/A,"I had the Google form, but I didn't get the email."
625.363,630.269,N/A,So this is something that I had to write for some of my job embedded program stuff.
630.289,639.419,N/A,It was like team lesson plan template stuff.
639.439,642.803,N/A,"So this template, I'm sure I have a blank one somewhere."
643.238,649.769,N/A,"So, like, standards that we're addressing, objectives, sub-objectives, materials and resources."
650.39,651.572,N/A,And so they rank each other?
651.592,652.573,N/A,Accommodations.
652.854,660.326,N/A,"Well, this was for engaging in argument for evidence regarding the impacts of human activity on climate change."
661.208,662.389,N/A,"So, I'm not sure."
662.77,664.373,N/A,I honestly don't remember what I did for this.
664.733,667.838,N/A,Can you dump it into ChatTBT and say change it to this standard?
668.88,670.022,N/A,We can.
694.741,699.187,N/A,"The more I have learned about how it's being done, the less."
699.287,700.188,N/A,Yes.
702.191,703.833,N/A,"I have used it, and I have."
704.394,713.145,N/A,I don't know a whole lot about that.
714.627,720.495,N/A,"What I find really funny, though, is that there's a Chinese company that is just"
721.994,725.198,N/A,fed information into ChatGPT and then stolen the responses.
725.238,726.86,N/A,"And ChatGPT is like, hey, you can't do that."
726.98,727.801,N/A,"And they're like, yeah, we can."
728.441,730.784,N/A,So you like made it free for us to do it.
730.804,731.585,N/A,So we did it.
731.625,734.668,N/A,Do we want to do how five words do you think our ecosystem is?
734.688,735.489,N/A,That's what I was at.
736.791,738.833,N/A,Do you want to stick with a general healthy?
739.013,743.258,N/A,Healthy for me would be something you could come back to.
743.358,745.661,N/A,I originally clicked on this one.
745.701,747.563,N/A,"And it was like, no, there's none of these."
748.555,750.298,N/A,"Yeah, but then I clicked on all of them."
750.358,756.246,N/A,"Yeah, it was like, bummer."
756.266,761.394,N/A,"Yeah, there's no high school here."
761.414,768.825,N/A,"But I like to see, yeah, like, what, like, that we could use idea-wise."
768.845,772.43,N/A,"Yeah, you sent one specific to what we were doing yesterday."
773.492,775.575,N/A,That was a neat site.
780.162,781.624,N/A,We don't have an assessment in ours.
781.745,785.11,N/A,I guess the writing at the end is the assessment.
785.13,790.78,N/A,How does classification of organisms help us determine?
790.8,794.747,N/A,"Well, in a dichotomous key is a tool used for classification."
794.867,802.52,N/A,So you could just state that they are learning to create a tool to help them find these reasoning within organisms.
802.54,803.301,N/A,So that would be an assessment.
805.795,806.917,N/A,And that's an independent.
807.358,810.323,N/A,Whatever you need it to be is what we can build it around.
811.785,813.608,N/A,Here's a team lesson plan template.
813.628,819.478,N/A,"But what I had was a Google Slides version, so you could just type on it."
819.498,821.001,N/A,"OK, can you make a copy and make it for this?"
821.101,822.724,N/A,We're only meant to do one unit.
822.764,823.485,N/A,We don't have to do.
823.605,825.649,N/A,We don't have to go crazy.
825.689,829.255,N/A,I think that if we can do multiple data collection
840.237,846.046,N/A,"It's a wood louse, pill bug, roly-poly, terrestrial life, you only have one termite."
847.509,854.84,N/A,We could all support each other and use common lesson planning.
854.96,856.703,N/A,"I mean, I would probably use one."
856.763,857.925,N/A,I don't have.
861.348,871.738,N/A,"If I'm with these people clicking on all these blank city shirts, it's like, I could spend so much time looking through all these materials."
871.758,872.779,N/A,I think it's just like never ending.
872.799,874.22,N/A,And come up with very little.
874.46,878.044,N/A,"Well yeah, Carolina has a field of behavior choices."
878.064,879.785,N/A,They've got a whole lesson plan.
881.086,888.233,N/A,"But ours is slightly different in that we're starting with, each of them are starting exploring just one species."
888.213,900.585,N/A,I think that's something I'm going to do is wrap this into evolution.
901.763,903.426,N/A,"And then, like, food webs and such."
903.446,907.434,N/A,"Well, yeah, it's definitely part of emulation."
907.574,909.979,N/A,"But there could be, like, a little bio blitz."
909.999,911.041,N/A,Can you find these little employees?
911.061,912.944,N/A,Can you find termites around school?
913.084,914.046,N/A,That'd be kind of fun.
914.066,916.771,N/A,"And then you could see, like, make observations, like, how they're hanging out."
916.791,919.637,N/A,Whitney Parson has her kids get extra credit for bringing their own.
919.657,922.522,N/A,"Do you have them, like, take a picture of them somewhere?"
922.542,924.987,N/A,I usually take a picture and create a document.
927.278,930.227,N/A,Who do you think she planned with me?
930.247,930.448,N/A,Ms.
930.548,931.13,N/A,Parsons?
931.431,934.981,N/A,I don't know if I've ever planned with her.
935.041,941.862,N/A,"Oh man, she sounds kind of difficult to work with."
946.448,967.68,N/A,David's not I
972.267,979.695,N/A,"they're wearing or whatever before they're trying to find harder, more minute differences in these two very similar plant leaves."
980.376,985.181,N/A,And so after coming up with all the data and creating the data table.
985.202,986.723,N/A,"I'm digging this Harvard website, though."
987.284,993.891,N/A,I would probably have them practice thinking why not before they actually make the one out of the leaves.
993.911,995.653,N/A,"They got this thing, adapted dye."
996.875,999.818,N/A,I'm trying to see if there's a way that.
999.838,1001.7,N/A,They got a moth on the cover.
1007.08,1018.218,N/A,The stuff before this one in this specific unit is like how can medical images and diagrams help us figure out more about the structures in our body?
1019.88,1021.543,N/A,Are all things native cells?
1024.628,1028.214,N/A,So I feel like I could definitely include in some sort of way.
1028.674,1031.319,N/A,I'm with a lot of the termite ones.
1031.419,1034.083,N/A,It's always about killing them.
1034.637,1037.421,N/A,"Other websites, pest control website."
1037.601,1044.672,N/A,I really need to go through each of these a lot more and figure out which part I've been trying to do.
1044.912,1051.062,N/A,"And it's been a lot like I'm having to stay through each lesson and take out what I want, what I just want."
1052.384,1055.228,N/A,Is this something when obviously you haven't made your case?
1071.712,1079.785,N/A,I don't know what kind of groups they're going to give me because as of right now on Aspen it's showing that I have two honors classes.
1079.885,1084.793,N/A,There's a chance I'm going to have two honors classes and two classes that are absolute.
1084.813,1087.577,N/A,"How many emails do you have in your inbox, guys?"
1092.468,1097.693,N/A,I pinned the ones that I needed later.
1098.794,1102.638,N/A,But our school is doing a pre-learning day.
1102.738,1104.38,N/A,They condensed it into a half a day.
1104.4,1107.503,N/A,"And you could go half a day today, or you have to do the full day on Thursday."
1108.864,1110.366,N/A,"I'm like, that's lame."
1110.486,1114.77,N/A,"Because now I have to do the full day, but I'm still working."
1114.93,1117.733,N/A,So I could do a unit on trees.
1117.713,1143.72,N/A,We did nerf wars once
1148.982,1150.304,N/A,and watching all these videos.
1150.324,1151.605,N/A,You guys watch them.
1151.625,1153.007,N/A,We should start videos right now.

1276.105,1278.068,N/A,What do you mean?
1278.168,1281.451,N/A,"I mean, it has a lot of good information."
1281.471,1286.076,N/A,"I didn't have anything about communication, so I don't want to use that one, right?"
1286.296,1288.399,N/A,Because I could come outside with you.
1289.079,1293.604,N/A,"I mean, it would still be beyond this class, but I could come outside and assist."
1293.624,1295.086,N/A,I love the idea of going out with your class.
1295.106,1297.148,N/A,"You know, I'll log in and see if they still"

1351.533,1357.206,N/A,"Okay, so you need to email Nick Reynolds."
1357.226,1366.065,N/A,A few times I've talked to him but I know that he's our wildlife teacher.
1366.45,1369.156,N/A,"Oh, I know that guy, actually."

1451.983,1459.755,N/A,Oh.
1474.298,1476.521,N/A,Because we were trying to figure it out yesterday.
1476.782,1479.626,N/A,And it's both ways in a lot of places.
1480.627,1487.277,N/A,But I feel like the consensus is the 1L.
1487.397,1493.747,N/A,"There's nothing like the children saying, you spelled that wrong."
1497.192,1502.179,N/A,"Field notes, termite trials and tribulations."
1504.403,1505.524,N/A,Which that works right here.
1505.544,1514.154,N/A,"It literally says, one of the assessment opportunities, constructing these dichotomous keys to classify objects based on the rule of the universe."
1514.735,1519.961,N/A,Identifying patterns used to prove items.
1519.981,1520.682,N/A,Select.

1532.275,1533.617,N/A,Thank you guys.
1535.538,1537.94,N/A,I kind of wish I could do it immediately.
1537.96,1543.867,N/A,"A lot of times, I do the termites as my introductory experiment for the year."
1544.647,1549.352,N/A,What do you do for your first?
1549.412,1558.722,N/A,"For AP, I usually get into standard deviation, standard error of the mean."
1559.042,1563.807,N/A,So one of my first things is water drops on a penny.
1587.04,1596.891,N/A,"This would be something late New Year's, like a spring in ecology for animal behavior, most likely."
1596.911,1599.434,N/A,I don't know where it was fit in for Bio One.
1601.676,1607.983,N/A,"Well, it's specifically built for Bio One because we need this standard base."
1608.003,1608.323,N/A,Right.
1608.424,1610.326,N/A,I'm not sure where I would put that in.
1610.966,1611.127,N/A,Right.
1611.267,1617.013,N/A,That's why I was kind of thinking put it in with safety at the beginning.
1625.127,1629.791,N/A,But it's a standard that needs to be covered before the test.
1630.092,1637.799,N/A,It's not a complicated lab to throw in there.
1638.139,1638.379,N/A,No.
1639.38,1643.664,N/A,"It sounds like a good way to introduce, like, science with lab."
1643.684,1644.525,N/A,That sounds dope.
1644.705,1646.967,N/A,I usually use it as nature of science.
1648.269,1651.191,N/A,So I just give them termites and pens.
1651.472,1654.054,N/A,"I'm like, so this is a termite."
1655.418,1658.881,N/A,"And I'm like, I draw a circle around my termite with my big pen."
1660.683,1662.765,N/A,"And I'm like, make observations."
1662.785,1664.506,N/A,"Yeah, I'll actually walk around in circles."
1664.726,1666.908,N/A,"And then they're like, he's walking on the line."
1667.409,1669.511,N/A,"And then so we make observations, they ask questions."
1669.571,1673.694,N/A,"Nature of science, what we do."
1675.256,1676.597,N/A,And so that's how I started.
1676.677,1677.958,N/A,We started our year last year.
1678.759,1681.922,N/A,So this wouldn't be a huge leap.
1682.082,1685.425,N/A,"And it covers one of my standards, not just nature of science."
1685.405,1691.953,N/A,"And it's before we get into, if I do, the problem is getting the supplies to do it."
1691.973,1693.996,N/A,"I don't have the chambers, I don't think."
1694.456,1695.978,N/A,"I might, if Whitney does it."
1696.198,1696.739,N/A,If it's an AP.
1697.32,1699.002,N/A,I don't know if that's what it's gonna be.
1699.022,1700.364,N/A,"I have a lot, it's in the AP curriculum."
1700.384,1701.405,N/A,"A lot of the time, we have a lot of chambers."
1701.425,1702.566,N/A,And it's specifically for.
1702.586,1706.732,N/A,And then we just meet up at DLD to do a shuffle.
1706.752,1707.533,N/A,We don't have DLD.
1707.933,1708.834,N/A,It's at Bay School.
1708.994,1710.636,N/A,"Yeah, they dumped us back."
1711.417,1711.578,N/A,Oh.
1711.638,1714.101,N/A,Because we're working with our teams on the new curriculum.
1714.161,1715.142,N/A,"It's a little bit different,"
1715.122,1722.85,N/A,"If you did not go to a curriculum meeting, you have to go to your curriculum meeting itself."
1722.97,1723.751,N/A,"Oh, did they change it?"
1724.051,1725.653,N/A,I didn't know what a curriculum meeting is.
1726.073,1727.775,N/A,What if I don't teach anything?
1727.795,1729.637,N/A,You don't have a textbook.
1729.657,1731.559,N/A,I don't know what they're doing with you.
1731.719,1733.161,N/A,You have to ask your department head.
1734.582,1736.404,N/A,We got dumped back on our department heads.
1737.345,1739.948,N/A,"Oh, I need to read that."
1740.299,1741.08,N/A,Like free time.
1741.501,1742.282,N/A,It's not really free.
1742.822,1744.184,N/A,I think I'll just work in my class.
1744.204,1745.346,N/A,I'll make that my first.
1745.466,1748.39,N/A,I'm going to do inquiry lab in my office.
1748.41,1751.734,N/A,I always like to start with plant biology as well.
1752.295,1754.238,N/A,"Yeah, but this would be an easy one to not get."
1755.339,1756.32,N/A,This would be an easy one to not get.
1756.34,1757.402,N/A,"I know, but I want to warm it up."
1757.522,1762.348,N/A,I want to get into like evolution and stuff and then get into like kind of ecology.
1762.368,1763.43,N/A,You're going to build it somewhere else.
1763.45,1765.092,N/A,"Yeah, I think I'll do it in this room."
1767.417,1784.734,N/A,"Oh, did we already get paid you're asking I think so Search no reply"

1801.592,1802.873,N/A,"Yeah, 7-18."
1802.893,1804.175,N/A,I don't know if I did.
1804.215,1804.735,N/A,We did.
1804.755,1806.497,N/A,"It's probably, it's just not where you're spending."

1982.437,1987.442,N/A,"But I think this morning, the sessions led by our teacher leaders did a great job of doing this."
1988.683,1991.166,N/A,"I think of the punchline for the first one being,"
2049.905,2053.191,N/A,"And then also, I just want to mention, I mentioned that credible connects to this idea."
2053.532,2061.969,N/A,It also it's an acronym stands for creatively reimagining engagements with data in biology learning environments somehow.
2062.029,2062.289,N/A,Okay.

2112.854,2117.238,N/A,"This might be something, sorry, transparently, this might be something we take on more next year."
2117.258,2120.021,N/A,"Yeah, Cody, go ahead."

2206.707,2208.535,N/A,nothing more than to learn what doesn't work.
2208.555,2212.633,N/A,"Actually, maybe even more than that, maybe what does work, but I mean, maybe later, like what doesn't work is."
2236.255,2239.12,N/A,Photos.
2239.761,2240.522,N/A,John shared this.
