18.307,26.537,N/A,"So when I put, so here's what I'm worried about."
26.818,27.278,N/A,Computer.
27.639,32.765,N/A,So all high school are going with you or are we just working within our group of three?
33.206,34.467,N/A,"Oh, it's because you have two values."
34.507,36.83,N/A,But let's go downstairs and then work on it.
36.85,40.395,N/A,"Yeah, you have to pick one value for it to calculate."
40.415,42.137,N/A,Then we'll start working on it.
45.408,46.569,N/A,Let's go check out what you got.
46.59,61.288,N/A,"It's just going to be kind of like a work session, bounce around, but I was just going to show you guys a couple things."
62.53,70.42,N/A,I'm going to go back to talk about how I would amend this project.
74.956,79.385,N/A,"So if you would like to use your computer to look at the slides, they're all up here right now."
79.446,86.721,N/A,So I've got a total of five slides to show you and then we'll break up and I've got a timer going so I don't take up too much of your time.
87.106,97.401,N/A,"So I'm like, to what Catherine did with us yesterday, she gave out the packet and we analyze the learning objective."
98.042,104.231,N/A,And then we kind of wrote out an idea or a model for how our experiment could go.
105.593,111.342,N/A,"So in the middle school setting, I would"
119.759,120.36,N/A,Are you okay?
120.981,121.682,N/A,"Oh, it's peanuts."
122.523,136.525,N/A,"Um, yeah, so I would kind of have them copy down the essential question, I would have them draw a model of how would the ecosystem was if it was healthy, or if the ecosystem was unhealthy, how would that look?"
136.545,143.155,N/A,"And then when they come back inside, so in my head, this is a piece of paper, and I would have them fold it in half hamburger style."
144.357,146.56,N/A,"And then after we've all collected our data,"
147.518,153.787,N/A,"then I would bring them back into the classroom, have them flip over to the other half of the paper."
153.827,155.369,N/A,So they're only looking at this one.
156.03,164.762,N/A,"And I would say, now that you have looked in your hula hoop, what actually did your ecosystem look like?"
164.782,172.513,N/A,"So for me, this is a much more reasonable way of the part of the data cycle where we are"
172.713,178.822,N/A,"where we're considering our models, I would be very explicit."
178.862,200.593,N/A,"And I would say, OK, now that we're done, now that you've drawn inside of your hula hoop as many non-moving biotic factors as possible, and then I would ask them to change their model and create a model of the ecosystem"
203.442,224.843,N/A,on the data because as I was saying our kids have this assumption that our school yard is dirty or is unhealthy and so I in my experience have seen students really change their ideas about the neighborhood that they live in and so hopefully their models
226.612,229.676,N/A,a circle with plants in it to show how it really looks.
229.696,236.044,N/A,And then I would have them go back to the essential question and change their answer like we did outside with Jen.
236.064,238.487,N/A,"And I would say, were you right or not?"
238.607,240.329,N/A,How confident are you now?
240.589,241.891,N/A,Did your confidence change?
242.232,245.055,N/A,So these are the questions I would ask.
246.337,249.761,N/A,And so then we would talk about why that is.
249.901,254.627,N/A,And that's one of the big differences in the middle school curriculum is that
255.856,264.867,N/A,"we aren't doing the Simpsons biodiversity index calculations with them, because that's not really developmentally appropriate, right?"
266.95,275.38,N/A,"So instead, I would focus on if we only had two things growing in our Hulu, why could that be?"
275.52,279.585,N/A,"And does anyone have any ideas for like, if you"
282.856,285.979,N/A,in one place like Tremont than you did in your school yard?
286.785,288.478,N/A,What could be some reasons for that?
332.873,342.275,N/A,And then we would talk about if they change their ideas to decide that our ecosystem actually is less healthy.
342.296,344.2,N/A,What does that look like?
347.082,371.217,N/A,nice healthy beautiful ecosystem it wasn't what does that look like so the way that you calculate Simpsons biodiversity index is with this beautiful formula and so Catherine and all of our high school friends right now are actually looking through the data that we aggregated and they are going to calculate the biodiversity
374.268,375.81,N/A,circle.
375.83,377.492,N/A,And I think that's really cool.
379.354,383.498,N/A,"So for your knowledge, here's the math that you would use."
383.518,385.981,N/A,And I love showing my kids formulas.
386.001,393.109,N/A,"And I love saying like, you are getting good to high school, you're going to be so smart, and you're going to be able to do this."
394.21,397.975,N/A,But I'm not going to have you do that because that's not in our standards.
397.995,402.84,N/A,"And so the higher the results number resulting number is that you get,"
403.276,406.901,N/A,the greater amount of biodiversity that a species has.
406.941,419.339,N/A,"So this number, if your diversity is 1.2, does that number alone, knowing, oh, it's 1.2, tell you anything?"
419.359,422.364,N/A,Do you guys know off the top of your heads if that's a higher low number?
422.664,423.866,N/A,"That was my question, too."
423.886,424.887,N/A,"No, not really."
425.308,431.697,N/A,"So what would you need to look at in order to know, do you have good or bad biodiversity?"
436.317,437.679,N/A,Exactly.
437.719,452.017,N/A,"So I can tell you guys, if you go to, you don't have to right now, but if you would like to look at how this could look in your school yard, in our resources, I have a link to where we did this in our school yard."
453.039,460.148,N/A,And so our students went around to different sites in our outdoor classroom.
460.786,479.166,N/A,and sites one two and three also all ended up having very similar less than one as a number of biodiversity which would make sense because they're all in the same place right can you guys tell which number so right here those are the calculations that we ended up with can you
483.263,484.185,N/A,"Yeah, site two."
485.107,487.732,N/A,And site three had the smallest amount.
487.792,489.335,N/A,"But again, they're really similar."
489.635,493.523,N/A,"Not super surprising, considering the fact that it was all in the same place, right?"
494.244,503.382,N/A,"So what they are doing right now, and we can take a little looky loo is they're all calculating."
508.103,514.513,N/A,And they are also calculating the number of unique individuals that were observed.
514.533,525.149,N/A,"And in the end, they will have a Simpson's index for everybody's site."
525.169,526.491,N/A,And so they'll be able to compare.
527.573,533.261,N/A,"I would be surprised if they were super different, because again, you're looking at all one location."
533.281,536.066,N/A,So what we're going to do now.
536.426,537.047,N/A,"Hi, welcome."
537.685,543.113,N/A,"What we're going to do now is talk about how would you use that data, right?"
543.133,550.143,N/A,So I would have my students reflect now that we've started with this model.
550.423,550.884,N/A,There we go.
551.084,551.926,N/A,We have five minutes left.
552.006,552.927,N/A,Good job.
552.947,557.173,N/A,"Now that we've started with this model, we've collected data, we've adjusted our model, right?"
557.474,563.322,N/A,"I would ask my students to pick one of these questions, and I would say, what worked well if you were going"
567.858,571.041,N/A,Have you all take a second and just think for 30 seconds.
573.544,579.83,N/A,"If you were going to do something else with this data, what would be your next step?"
579.85,582.593,N/A,So you end up with something that looks similar to this.
582.753,584.074,N/A,You've got site 123.
584.835,588.559,N/A,You know what your diversity number is.
589.92,595.806,N/A,"I want you to take 30 seconds and just kind of think, what is the next thing that you could have your students do with this?"
597.457,599.353,N/A,to make this meaningful.
599.374,602.117,N/A,And then we can spit all a little bit before we start working.
634.615,640.711,N/A,So maybe comparing to tremont right?
640.731,645.464,N/A,"Comparing to Gresham's garden, who has more biodiversity?"
645.484,648.372,N/A,Gresham's garden or South Doyle's garden?
681.19,707.299,N/A,Right right and that kind of That kind of goes back to what we were saying about our okay if you were gonna draw an unhealthy Any other ideas for how you might take this and I
709.743,716.603,N/A,"I keep losing my place because we put day three, but this is day three, but sorry."
716.623,716.944,N/A,"No, that's okay."
716.964,722.841,N/A,"I was just thinking on that to also be careful of like this bias of, well, it's okay that there's"
745.906,747.328,N/A,It's not a moral failing.
749.793,761.873,N/A,"So one thing that I do with my students to extend this is I break them up into groups of four and I would have each student say,"
778.61,795.319,N/A,"Alright, so we're going to be Mr. Dave's class next nine weeks, what we do to improve the biodiversity and so I would have them sit down and without sharing first because sometimes our kids get influenced by their peers, have them write out their solution and then some pros they think"
796.615,800.158,N/A,"and some cons, like pros, it would look really pretty, cons, it might cost money."
800.178,820.998,N/A,"I'd have them come back together, and I would have them use this table to rank everyone's solutions to improving biodiversity, and then they would agree on what the best possible solution is, they would come to a consensus, maybe you, I really like Miss Kayla's plan, but we need to tweak this and this."
821.018,823.741,N/A,"So, perfect timing, it is now 12 o'clock."
823.761,826.183,N/A,"So, for the next 30 minutes,"
826.94,829.825,N/A,I invite you to create a product.
831.508,837.678,N/A,"If y'all want to work in pairs, or if you just want to work by yourself, we have this slideshow linked here."
839.141,842.006,N/A,So here we go.
842.026,843.348,N/A,Middle school products.
849.158,851.222,N/A,Perfect.
851.242,851.462,N/A,Yeah.
858.192,871.456,N/A,So how can I help you sit you're really lost how can I clarify?
871.616,876.825,N/A,So what what are your thoughts what part of the data do you think you're gonna find?
914.268,916.251,N/A,But that's with your data.
916.271,917.673,N/A,"Yeah, so let's steal."
917.954,918.955,N/A,I'm not going to delete it.
919.175,920.157,N/A,I'm manifesting it.
920.217,920.978,N/A,It's going to be OK.
921.9,927.228,N/A,"I made a copy, and then I started to change things."
927.248,927.348,N/A,Yeah.
927.368,928.43,N/A,Tremont Bio Chi Chi.
932.255,939.146,N/A,"So let's do site is the groups, right?"
939.166,939.887,N/A,Copy.
953.637,961.43,N/A,"No, not one through three."
961.45,962.091,N/A,Can I see the other spreadsheet?
962.111,963.854,N/A,Should I make a copy of this one?
963.874,965.857,N/A,"You have the thing copied in there, right?"
965.877,972.508,N/A,It's just that there was less cells filled up.
972.588,977.336,N/A,So see how it went to four right here?
977.356,978.398,N/A,It's just that it went past it.
978.418,978.598,N/A,"Oh, wait."
985.278,986.66,N/A,I don't know.
986.7,988.302,N/A,"Tell me what to do, Cody."
988.362,990.885,N/A,I don't know how to transfer it.
990.905,993.368,N/A,"So I want to use, yeah."
993.388,994.27,N/A,"Well, not this one."
994.29,998.415,N/A,I want to do it with that spreadsheet that has the formula already in it.
998.515,1005.023,N/A,"So if you go here, this is where you put the formulas in, right there."
1005.043,1009.91,N/A,I don't know how to make that go into this.
1010.03,1010.29,N/A,Go into this?
1017.644,1024.731,N/A,Everyone's data lives right here.
1024.791,1026.873,N/A,But they're working on this one.
1026.893,1029.576,N/A,So this is the site.
1029.596,1030.497,N/A,This is the species.
1031.177,1038.765,N/A,And this is the amount.
1039.125,1040.967,N/A,So I'm going to move this.
1040.987,1042.649,N/A,"Wait, wait."
1042.669,1043.369,N/A,People are working on that one.
1043.389,1044.31,N/A,So make a copy of it.
1044.33,1044.951,N/A,Click File.
1046.045,1049.129,N/A,"They're like, what is going on?"
1049.149,1053.175,N/A,"They're like, middle school's not supposed to do math."
1053.456,1068.117,N/A,"And now we have, these are Cs, I'm gonna move this over here."
1068.958,1072.643,N/A,"Yeah, you guys wanna just do one group and work together for the middle school?"
1082.14,1083.982,N/A,So they're sick.
1084.002,1099.035,N/A,There's six sites.
1099.235,1100.056,N/A,Join the union.
1100.216,1100.716,N/A,All right.
1100.736,1101.217,N/A,Yeah.
1101.237,1101.957,N/A,That's how I get t shirt.
1101.977,1102.318,N/A,I'll do it.
1102.338,1103.259,N/A,I'll do anything for t shirt.
1103.399,1104.079,N/A,David.
1104.159,1107.903,N/A,So he has power.
1109.444,1110.645,N/A,I wonder
