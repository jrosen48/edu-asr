27.031,29.498,N/A,We're gonna need...
61.253,79.977,N/A,And then you'll see from 24 on is all you're gonna need today.
80.117,82.62,N/A,"Okay, so don't worry about scrolling back up that was from yesterday"
93.603,103.495,N/A,"Megan, do you have our hula hoop numbers?"
121.025,122.527,N/A,"Yeah, yeah, just a second."
122.567,123.749,N/A,So let me show you all this real quick.
124.21,125.551,N/A,So here we have aquatic.
126.192,128.195,N/A,And then this is our data from yesterday.
128.235,131.44,N/A,"Remember, the fifth one was unique because it was runoff data."
131.46,134.064,N/A,It wasn't from the actual river stream.
134.084,136.367,N/A,"But instead, it was from a puddle that came from."
136.467,143.317,N/A,"So if you want to analyze that data later, just remember that this is just a little bit unique."
143.337,144.278,N/A,"So yeah, outliers."
144.298,150.407,N/A,"So if you wanted to compare five and two, maybe when you do your data presentation, I guess I'm giving you a preview of what you're going to be doing."
151.113,156.1,N/A,"After we input all the data, we're going to split up into middle school groups and high school groups."
156.921,161.848,N/A,And the middle school group is going to have a little work session as a group.
161.868,164.051,N/A,And the high school group is going to have a little work session as a group.
164.412,165.633,N/A,And then we're going to have partners.
165.774,168.497,N/A,And you're going to pick whatever data you want to analyze.
168.838,169.359,N/A,It doesn't matter.
169.739,172.463,N/A,You're going to graph whatever data you want to analyze.
177.843,190.403,N/A,"One thing we wanted to make sure we did today, and I know we're all tired and this is probably not the funnest part, but a lot of times when we go to PDs, we hit all those like beginning things, right, like ooh, great activity, ooh, great activity, but you didn't get to the end."
190.844,199.097,N/A,"So we really wanted to make sure today that we got to the part of inputting the data, creating something with the data to make sure we've done that whole song."
199.858,203.985,N/A,"A lot of us, it's a race now, but at the beginning, we asked y'all like,"
233.699,240.472,N/A,"So before we go, let's go through some expectations, but let's put the data in first."
240.712,246.022,N/A,"So everyone, Megan, who is your partner?"
246.082,246.383,N/A,Justin?
246.924,247.605,N/A,"OK, you guys are one."
248.126,249.408,N/A,Who is your partner?
249.488,250.47,N/A,You weren't feeling well.
250.49,251.151,N/A,That's OK.
251.172,251.813,N/A,Who is your partner?
252.855,257.884,N/A,"OK, you guys are number two."
280.865,281.346,N/A,And then five.
283.651,285.414,N/A,Is that all the hoops we have?
286.597,287.719,N/A,Six?
287.739,289.683,N/A,They were five?
290.384,291.046,N/A,You guys are six?
292.068,295.495,N/A,"So when you look here, all you do, you can see your group number."
295.635,297.378,N/A,"You can see A through, right?"
297.418,299.563,N/A,Is everyone good with putting that in?
299.583,299.683,N/A,Okay.
312.269,330.273,N/A,I remembered the numbers of like the clover and the other thing.
335.0,341.348,N/A,How many species did we actually have
349.175,352.587,N/A,It's the best I could do.
378.74,383.749,N/A,So find a median of those two numbers.
383.769,387.576,N/A,"Sure, let's say 90."
388.498,395.01,N/A,We indicated indeed how many species we found.
410.212,427.495,N/A,But I thought the number of species in
429.179,436.591,N/A,We estimated 150 to 200.
436.611,448.791,N/A,There was a lot of this very round thing.
452.804,454.627,N/A,And that was most of our other.
454.787,456.41,N/A,Since some of us are done.
456.43,458.212,N/A,So how many species do you have in other?
458.373,459.494,N/A,I'm just going to ask a couple.
463.28,464.582,N/A,We had a few.
464.602,468.188,N/A,"It was mostly those round things, maybe four or five species."
468.469,469.871,N/A,And then just mostly the round things.
469.911,472.635,N/A,"Yeah, there was a lot of those."
476.564,480.514,N/A,I was just gonna ask a couple random questions before we split up.
481.055,482.74,N/A,How do y'all feel about ones?
484.384,488.975,N/A,"When we put a one, don't change it, but that's one."
489.036,493.948,N/A,Is one significant in your biodiversity plot?
495.127,499.233,N/A,"Yes, because there could be one there, but adjacent there could be 20."
499.273,500.675,N/A,"There you go, nice, cool."
500.695,501.777,N/A,So it was present.
501.957,502.638,N/A,"Yeah, agreed."
502.698,506.624,N/A,"So one may not be significant in one hoop, right?"
506.744,512.593,N/A,"But then like you said, if we look at all the hoops, maybe then it is more significant because we're looking at that larger area, right?"
512.633,513.574,N/A,"So yeah, beautiful."
513.554,521.484,N/A,"But if you're just, if you met your one little hula hoop and not really thinking about the rest of the area, that one might just kind of be an outlier maybe."
521.505,525.129,N/A,"So when you think about like the math and stuff in a little bit, think about those ones."
525.189,528.674,N/A,But also I like what Michelle said with thinking about the whole area too.
528.714,531.838,N/A,"So like when you think about the data and whatever you want to analyze, think about that."
532.579,534.782,N/A,"So okay, so that's there."
534.802,535.303,N/A,We've got that.
536.264,542.312,N/A,"When you go back to the slides, this is me and Jen kind of worked through this yesterday."
547.439,553.365,N/A,"All right, so just wanted to kind of bring back this ABC, and then we're really gonna focus on step B when we."
564.685,566.607,N/A,"There we go, Bayesian approach."
566.747,568.83,N/A,"So Josh talked about this, Jen talked about this."
569.811,574.717,N/A,So you start off with your research question and your initial response.
574.937,577.24,N/A,So the A is account for what you know.
577.26,578.401,N/A,So what do you already know?
578.421,580.864,N/A,What is your initial response to the research question?
580.884,583.748,N/A,What was our original research question for Tremont?
583.768,584.889,N/A,Is it a healthy ecosystem?
584.909,585.33,N/A,Right.
585.35,587.012,N/A,Is it healthy or how healthy is it?
587.052,587.632,N/A,So either way.
589.034,592.498,N/A,"So your initial response, so let's all think back to our initial response."
595.313,600.42,N/A,"So now we're going to take that data, and we're really going to focus on that data."
600.78,605.827,N/A,"And then when you make your little slide or whatever, we're still going to think about this confidence."
606.067,608.57,N/A,Do you still feel as confident as your initial response?
608.891,610.633,N/A,Would you feel as confident as your initial response?
610.653,613.857,N/A,So Audrey talked about when you guys go out to the creek a little bit sometimes.
613.877,615.439,N/A,So they think that it's going to be awful.
615.459,619.144,N/A,"Yeah, so we talk a lot about the water cycle in sixth grade."
642.53,646.617,N/A,And they have this kind of idea of our school.
646.677,648.76,N/A,They call it South Gusty.
648.84,652.747,N/A,"And that's part of their identity, right?"
652.847,653.989,N/A,That's fine.
654.95,659.037,N/A,And so it's really shocking to them when we go out and we actually do the water data.
689.071,694.656,N/A,"Okay, so as Justin and a few people just told us, what is the health of the ecosystem of streamline goes in."
694.916,700.481,N/A,So I'm wondering if you have any questions about the ABCs before we go into that.
701.322,718.858,N/A,"Okay, so also to remind you, ABC is not just one cycle of that every time when we reach C with yearly all students, if we want to, how can we add new"
760.537,765.663,N/A,So this is Krebs's thoughts through my words.
766.223,772.691,N/A,"So when we work together, I don't know if you've ever seen this, but he goes and you know, you watch his brain work, right?"
772.891,775.914,N/A,"And then I'm like, hold on a second, and I'm like, all right, let's get these thoughts together."
775.954,779.839,N/A,"So if you have any questions, we'll ask for him on this too."
779.859,782.021,N/A,But so what's the health of the ecosystem of Tremont?
782.041,783.062,N/A,"What's your confidence, right?"
783.082,783.703,N/A,So remember that.
784.584,789.97,N/A,"So before we go break up into our separate groups, we're gonna do a little mini activity, and then you're gonna do this."
790.321,793.486,N/A,Get with a partner and analyze your choice of data using one of the analysis tools.
793.566,795.169,N/A,We're just going to do Google Sheets or CodeNet.
795.189,799.997,N/A,"Let's not jump into data classroom, just because that's the complexity and everything."
800.037,802.301,N/A,"It's not hard, but you know what I mean."
802.321,805.065,N/A,You're going to create a product of whatever data you want.
805.426,814.381,N/A,"If you want to compare two plots of terrestrial, if you want to compare aquatic runoff and the stream, it's literally your world."
814.401,816.244,N/A,"If you want to compare all of the plots,"
818.03,819.854,N/A,and see whatever you want to do.
819.934,820.835,N/A,"It's your world, okay?"
821.978,824.222,N/A,So create a product of whatever data you want.
824.963,828.811,N/A,Process it into a graph and write some sort of a conclusion.
828.831,829.492,N/A,What do you see?
829.652,830.314,N/A,What do you notice?
830.374,833.159,N/A,What trends are observed?
834.301,838.249,N/A,"This part is really important to David, and"
839.9,847.594,N/A,"I even if it's not formally done on the slide, I still want you guys so like this is your creative product and it's going to be on the slides."
847.615,848.376,N/A,I'll show you in just a second.
849.799,862.262,N/A,"If you are able to, I really want you to either write out a rubric of what you expect of your students at this point and see if you fulfilled it or write out a rubric of what you did and see if you wanted to like enhance that a little bit."
862.732,865.014,N/A,So that's something super important to him.
866.055,868.418,N/A,So hopefully we'll be able to do all that as well.
869.078,870.44,N/A,But it's also our comfort zone.
870.46,875.325,N/A,"If some of us it takes longer to do data analysis and produce graphs and come to a conclusion, that's okay."
875.966,885.315,N/A,So just know like at the end we're all going to be presenting these little presentations and just like as artifacts to kind of show where we're all at.
885.615,887.237,N/A,So we're all at different levels and that's kind of
897.325,905.884,N/A,"And then we'll compare and present your findings with another group, how can we process the data differently, what questions could we ask, and stuff like that."
940.812,948.863,N/A,"It's really, if you have time to accomplish one through three before we get to step four, do that to the best of your ability."
948.963,956.693,N/A,"And if you get to the end of step one, then your data is what you'd like to share with the group."
956.713,958.876,N/A,That is also fully OK.
958.896,966.125,N/A,It's really however you choose to communicate how you respond to our overarching questions.
966.145,967.647,N/A,"OK, we hit one more next."
995.555,1007.556,N/A,So that's where we're at in the data cycle.
1032.427,1036.552,N/A,the results of the analysis to answer their research question.
1036.572,1041.678,N/A,"Also, based on research question, what are the other thoughts that they have about actions that they can propose?"
1041.759,1045.203,N/A,It's like device solutions to the local community.
1045.804,1049.248,N/A,So that's the proposed action part.
1049.268,1054.074,N/A,So think about what we've been doing for the past three days.
1054.274,1057.438,N/A,We basically go through
1064.236,1074.852,N/A,And also the data cycle is one of the research pillars that Josh mentioned yesterday.
1074.972,1082.363,N/A,"So when you design your activity, ideally we want the"
1084.925,1096.542,N/A,"And sometimes the cycle is like a linear process, but sometimes when, for example, you frame a question, there's also students to consider what kind of data they can gather."
1097.363,1110.021,N/A,"Based on the next step, they may go back to reframe the problem because the original problem is not measurable or there's no way that they can test it."
1110.001,1121.036,N/A,"Within this big cycle, there can be smaller cycles to modify the problems or reconsider what kind of data they want to use."
1121.056,1125.723,N/A,So that's also a fluid part of this data cycle.
1125.743,1126.944,N/A,Beautiful.
1126.964,1128.066,N/A,"All right, one more slide."
1129.949,1131.03,N/A,"Just kidding, one more."
1132.883,1137.355,N/A,"You're going to build these products in your shared slideshow, so don't worry about that yet."
1137.455,1139.16,N/A,We're going to split into middle school and high school right now.
1139.26,1140.223,N/A,We're going to do a mini lesson.
1140.504,1141.888,N/A,"High school, you're going to do a little bit of math."
1142.028,1143.552,N/A,"Middle school, you're going to talk a little bit about math."
1159.883,1165.27,N/A,"If you choose to use any kind of comparative water data, we just wanted to point out a couple things."
1166.211,1167.773,N/A,Josh just did this.
1167.793,1169.154,N/A,"Oh, can you refresh it?"
1169.435,1171.718,N/A,"You might have to refresh it, because we just added it."
1172.799,1174.221,N/A,"Oh, there it is."
1174.241,1174.321,N/A,OK.
1174.361,1179.908,N/A,"So one is a code app, and the other one is the same information with Google Sheets."
1179.928,1180.328,N/A,Nice.
1180.348,1183.111,N/A,"But one really cool feature, like if you click on the code app one."
1184.673,1186.836,N/A,So this is all Knox County data.
1190.798,1191.8,N/A,We can talk about that.
1191.9,1208.005,N/A,"And then the cool thing about this that you could use with your students if you're not familiar with Code App is that you can put all your data in and then you can share that with students so they don't have to go through the trouble of doing that stuff, which is nice for middle schoolers."
1208.666,1212.672,N/A,But can you show them where you share it?
1218.136,1238.748,N/A,"It needs to be cleaned, I think."
1239.148,1239.769,N/A,Let's see.
1239.789,1244.937,N/A,"So when you think of bar graph, what do you think of conceptually?"
1260.88,1262.862,N/A,"Yeah, sure, sure, sure."
1262.882,1269.247,N/A,"Yeah, so conceptually what I'm hearing, and this is, I think I was pretty sure on the same page, is yeah, you've got a category on the x-axis."
1270.268,1275.592,N/A,So where you'll go astray is if you have a numeric variable on the x-axis.
1275.953,1277.454,N/A,"It's just, you're not really gonna get there."
1278.975,1290.685,N/A,"Yeah, thanks."
1315.96,1318.584,N/A,"I guess what, sorry."
1318.604,1323.251,N/A,I guess I was visualizing a little more of what David had in his presentation where he had multiple dots and then a bar.
1323.671,1325.915,N/A,Yeah.
1325.935,1326.876,N/A,"The, like, error or whatever."
1326.896,1327.838,N/A,"Sure, yeah."
1328.158,1332.204,N/A,"That's in the data classroom, so we were just going to use, like, Code App or Google Sheets today."
1332.264,1333.226,N/A,You can get there too.
1333.246,1334.207,N/A,I think you can get there.
1334.227,1335.028,N/A,"Code App you can, right?"
1335.048,1335.669,N/A,"Yeah, I think so."
1335.689,1341.398,N/A,"If you click on the, maybe that measuring stick there, I think you can add a mean for each of the groups and a standard."
1341.418,1341.518,N/A,Yeah.
1342.179,1342.98,N/A,There's a mean.
1353.44,1356.264,N/A,"So maybe it looks a little different, but same idea."
1356.284,1359.429,N/A,We've got the measure of central tendency and then this kind of error bar.
1359.529,1371.126,N/A,"And if you take out, like, you can look at all of it."
1371.146,1372.288,N/A,You don't want to sort it.
1372.328,1372.648,N/A,I've got it.
1372.668,1373.049,N/A,Great question.
1373.089,1379.278,N/A,"To put a plug in for code app, I think the cool thing is it asks you to think a little more conceptually about like, like I think kids will think"
1380.355,1384.321,N/A,"I want a bar chart, but they have a numeric x-axis variable."
1384.701,1386.804,N/A,Like it's a variable that literally ranges from 0 to 100.
1387.345,1388.587,N/A,You can't really get to a bar chart.
1388.707,1397.78,N/A,"You could like chunk up your numeric variable and have like 0 to 20, but that's usually with statistics and data, we don't want to turn a continuous variable into a categorical one."
1397.8,1399.623,N/A,"Unless it is a categorical variable, like a site."
1399.743,1400.584,N/A,A site is not a number.
1400.644,1401.345,N/A,It's a site.
1401.646,1402.667,N/A,It's a name or an ID.
1409.701,1411.804,N/A,that you're trying to represent.
1411.824,1412.786,N/A,"Anyway, sorry, we're on the same page."
1412.826,1420.258,N/A,"But I think it's a good, it's one thing Kodak really emphasizes is you have to think a little bit more about like, what are these axes represent?"
