2.579,6.464,N/A,There's another piece to this.
7.385,12.232,N/A,"These veins are paired, whereas these are alternate as well."
14.995,18.019,N/A,"We've got serrated edges, very similar shape."
18.46,30.375,N/A,If we were to take one leaf and compare them...
30.76,33.422,N/A,"Yeah, these veins are paired better than these are."
34.123,41.169,N/A,"But aside from that, there's not a... I don't know, it's a little fatter at the base, but there's a little fatter in the middle."
42.63,43.431,N/A,How about the edges?
43.471,45.393,N/A,Maybe that's a bad one that I gave you.
45.733,46.293,N/A,Look at this one.
46.313,46.914,N/A,This is smoother.
46.974,48.155,N/A,These are a little more serrate.
48.295,49.056,N/A,"Right, right."
50.577,55.461,N/A,And what do you notice about the venation compared to this one?
56.742,59.805,N/A,"I mean, like I said, these ones alternate, whereas these ones are paired more."
60.275,68.991,N/A,How about where they wind up on the edge of the leaf?
69.332,82.637,N/A,"So these are the different kinds of tree seeds that we could think of, a couple examples of ones we found."
83.14,86.708,N/A,"We don't actually know the names of them, but we learned that it's not that important."
87.309,93.924,N/A,But these I used to use as a kid to throw them out of the playground.
94.084,98.113,N/A,And then I got to thinking about how these things I used to throw up.
98.153,100.719,N/A,"And Buckeyes were always for luck, right?"
101.2,102.583,N/A,And Walnuts were high.
102.563,122.135,N/A,"We do a thing called seasonal rounds, like thinking about the different times of year and the things that are important in your life or in your family."
122.155,130.208,N/A,"And it's like, you know, we always throw each other in the ballroom."
134.474,149.94,N/A,This is the Red Chateau Rail.
150.12,155.249,N/A,It's found on the rivers in the eastern side of the USA.
155.269,156.01,N/A,It's typically
156.445,159.909,N/A,"edible, so if you want to eat it and you're hungry, you can eat one or the other side."
159.929,162.552,N/A,"I know, I saw that the other day and I was like, is it edible?"
162.572,164.153,N/A,"And I was like, yes it is."
164.173,170.821,N/A,"Yeah, you even put on your pizza as a, I forgot her name, told us she put some of her pizza in Virginia, which I would not do, but she eats her own."
171.381,175.966,N/A,It's typically found around parkwood trees in the summer and fall seasons.
175.986,181.052,N/A,"They're not always easy to find when they're easy to find, or when you do find them anyway."
181.167,208.643,N/A,Hm.
208.623,230.775,N/A,"Well, that was something that I need to be reminded of."
230.875,235.221,N/A,I oftentimes forget that it is like further in.
235.201,237.126,N/A,And I don't know.
237.166,243.263,N/A,"Somebody else said that if you broke this in half, what would you actually see inside?"
243.283,244.587,N/A,"So that was cool, too."
245.005,246.287,N/A,"Was this broken, or was this?"
246.367,247.489,N/A,It was all like this.
247.609,249.051,N/A,I just uncovered it from leaves.
249.071,253.318,N/A,"Because I wondered if that's the nice feeling, maybe?"
253.739,254.78,N/A,They are thread-like.
254.921,259.408,N/A,They have like a magnifying glass or something.
259.428,260.63,N/A,I thought I already told you something.
260.65,261.251,N/A,I can tell you something.
261.271,261.731,N/A,Thank you.
261.912,262.633,N/A,Thank you.
262.653,266.018,N/A,Mine is about the interconnectedness in nature.
265.998,269.064,N/A,those of us here are kind of along the same lines.
269.084,280.446,N/A,"And so I found it fascinating that they're all living in a very small space and there's at least four organisms visible, probably more that are microorganisms."
280.686,284.614,N/A,"But we have two types of moss, a fir,"
284.594,300.434,N/A,"and the lichen, and it's a folioslichen, so it's very sensitive, and they depend upon each other for nutrients, and they also synergize to be more together, and they are individual."
300.555,302.878,N/A,"So, I really am happy for this."
303.178,310.888,N/A,"I love the little tin drills you can see from the bottom of the lichen, you know?"
310.868,312.49,N/A,Thank you.
312.691,315.194,N/A,I like the folios because you don't have it at our school.
315.274,321.063,N/A,So I have a long stalk here.
321.483,324.047,N/A,And then I have the fruit bearing part.
324.588,325.99,N/A,And I drew it a little bit bigger.
326.07,327.152,N/A,So the spores will be here.
327.272,328.734,N/A,And they are sexually reproducing.
328.754,329.835,N/A,I did not mention that.
330.176,335.484,N/A,But the spores can be spread across the environment via wind or water.
335.544,339.93,N/A,"So obviously, in the Smokies, as you know, it's a very humid climate with a lot of water."
339.91,344.095,N/A,What makes it a feather?
344.897,346.398,N/A,I don't think I've ever heard that distinction.
346.819,349.643,N/A,I know that they're talking about feather mouses from what I read.
349.663,351.765,N/A,I'm not too expert at this.
351.785,353.448,N/A,It's just the feathery texture.
353.688,355.09,N/A,And I try to draw it like here.
355.17,358.514,N/A,So some of them branch out and they look like feathers.
358.715,362.56,N/A,So that's from what I gather and my best explanation.
362.68,365.243,N/A,But I can't give a full actual scientific answer.
365.223,370.252,N/A,So the fingery ones that Michelle's collected there would be a feather moss?
370.272,370.672,N/A,Yes.
370.752,371.414,N/A,Okay.
371.434,385.257,N/A,So and then the one I took an image of was more like closer to the ground so they're more like low lane like feather moss or mosses in general but the ones I took up they were more like sporadic and tinier compared to hers but she has two different mosses.
385.237,386.038,N/A,Yeah.
386.098,387.539,N/A,And then I did some quick hitters on it.
387.579,390.382,N/A,So they're great habitat space for insects.
390.402,391.543,N/A,It's a nice sample.
391.563,393.385,N/A,Solve the snails to smell like the mommy.
393.785,398.229,N/A,And then I also mentioned how they're great for mitigating climate change.
398.269,402.913,N/A,They're able to absorb a lot of carbon dioxide in the air.
402.933,408.719,N/A,So it's a great way to have something in the snow face that's part of the system.
408.739,410.16,N/A,"Does that one, OK."
410.2,412.262,N/A,Or a lot of our carbon dioxide.
412.282,413.303,N/A,"Yeah, yeah."
413.283,414.405,N/A,And that is mine.
414.546,415.067,N/A,Amazing.
415.147,416.269,N/A,I love the arts.
416.329,417.01,N/A,Yep.
417.752,420.457,N/A,I was trying to do it really fast and I accidentally went up there instead.
420.517,421.7,N/A,"Oh, you're downstairs."
421.74,423.443,N/A,It's like I did not listen.
423.483,424.085,N/A,Beautiful.
424.205,426.449,N/A,Good for already dreaming about what to do next.
426.469,428.233,N/A,Have you read Gathering Moss?
428.273,428.794,N/A,I have not.
428.774,431.78,N/A,It's highly recommended.
431.82,435.367,N/A,It is one of Robin Wall Kimmerer's books.
435.627,449.314,N/A,"And one of the things that she talks about is how when Moss sends up spore fights, they have to be exactly the right distance above the Moss to catch the right kind of air current."
449.294,479.301,N/A,"Okay, I was quite curious on that, especially because some of the things I've read was mentioning like water droplets, and I was curious on if like water droplets are just going directly down, then it's just in that area, it's not actually spreading."
479.281,505.255,N/A,So what we're doing now is we're good.
505.64,506.201,N/A,Hi.
506.822,507.063,N/A,Hello.
507.464,515.599,N/A,We decided to collect a lot of cool things that we found and create a game with it.
515.639,521.05,N/A,"So we were thinking about how our kids and kind of we do too, they come up to us and they're like, what is this?"
521.03,521.891,N/A,Look what I found.
521.911,522.652,N/A,Look what I found.
522.693,523.253,N/A,What is this?
523.834,525.957,N/A,So we found a bunch of random things.
526.198,540.099,N/A,"There's two different ways you can play the game, which is you can categorize them, organize them into two groups if you choose, or you could pick one item and tell us a story about that item."
540.119,542.122,N/A,It's up to you.
542.142,543.864,N/A,And the story can be a scientific story.
543.904,545.226,N/A,It could be a non-scientific story.
545.246,546.088,N/A,It could be a memory.
546.829,550.294,N/A,Some of these things we found during this week.
550.274,553.799,N/A,Which is why we included those as well.
553.819,556.203,N/A,I couldn't find our tree.
557.966,558.787,N/A,Is that your item?
558.907,561.13,N/A,It's the Smoky Mountain Mellow Mushroom Pizza.
561.871,563.834,N/A,Mellow Mushroom Smoky Mountain Special.
564.956,566.378,N/A,Dragonfly in the center.
566.398,568.241,N/A,There you go.
568.281,569.202,N/A,The Red Chanterelle.
570.384,570.985,N/A,That's your mushroom?
571.005,572.267,N/A,Which we learned from you just now.
574.01,577.615,N/A,"I was just like, it's orange, and then he said red, and I was like, all right, I like it."
579.113,580.334,N/A,And then for after the pizza.
581.836,584.619,N/A,"You're going to need that after this pizza, for sure."
584.76,587.202,N/A,Which I never would think about until after this week.
589.645,592.829,N/A,"And then the trash from the pizza, I guess."
595.132,600.718,N/A,"Just a reminder of how we all just are like, hey, look what I found."
600.998,601.899,N/A,"Oh my gosh, what is this?"
601.959,605.003,N/A,"All the questions, which is what we were talking about."
606.35,610.777,N/A,How much you want to bet they put the mushrooms with the plants?
610.797,611.157,N/A,"Oh, yeah."
611.177,611.979,N/A,They definitely would.
612.079,612.68,N/A,I think they would.
612.78,613.781,N/A,It came out of the ground.
613.801,614.563,N/A,That's what they would say.
615.043,616.225,N/A,Do you do that in Nova Lab?
616.385,617.307,N/A,"Oh, yeah."
617.327,619.15,N/A,I love the Nova Evolution Lab.
619.27,622.575,N/A,"The first question, yeah."
622.735,625.76,N/A,"I used to spend a week on that, just that activity."
626.841,627.002,N/A,So good.
627.362,628.264,N/A,I don't think my kids would.
628.284,629.165,N/A,I do it with eighth grade.
629.566,630.187,N/A,"OK, I do it."
630.207,630.587,N/A,I love it.
630.607,633.792,N/A,I just do one introduction to it.
633.957,637.162,N/A,"I'll do like, I usually take like three days."
637.182,648.299,N/A,"I'll do like two, there's six groups, six whatever, and I do like two a day and have like the four page worksheet that goes with each one."
648.319,650.302,N/A,There's like 27 pages of worksheets that go with each one.
650.342,654.548,N/A,"And you like throw it all out and you're like, oh my god, but if you give them one at a time."
657.093,664.288,N/A,"With that being said, it also plays a role in helping to clean up the area around it so it takes away from any of the things that might bother you."
664.408,665.731,N/A,You might call them bugs.
665.871,675.651,N/A,"And some of those pests might be mosquitoes, flies, gnats, or anything else that might bother you or bother you."
675.691,678.797,N/A,"And with that as well, spiderwebs also do a very good job at"
679.655,695.741,N/A,"taking away some of the particulate in the area with electrostatic forces in the web, they also are going to grab pollen, dust, and even some pollutants, not usually, that will then keep that area a little bit more, as we would say, clean, breathable, especially for those that have allergies."
696.723,704.295,N/A,"And that's why my pitch, the most underappreciated organism, or something that you find on a trail, will be spider webs."
706.486,729.33,N/A,What is underappreciated on the trail?
729.39,734.535,N/A,I'm here to tell you
734.515,735.416,N/A,You're going to tell me?
735.476,735.976,N/A,I'm going to tell you.
736.177,736.417,N/A,OK.
736.457,737.838,N/A,"Tell me, what is underappreciated?"
738.359,741.722,N/A,"If I get into this before I do that, this was kind of a guiding question."
741.923,745.286,N/A,"Is this like a specific trail, like Whisperside Falls Trail?"
745.366,745.907,N/A,Exactly.
745.967,748.249,N/A,"Oh, there we go."
748.329,752.814,N/A,"So it's kind of like the idea, the guiding question is kind of what I took this as."
752.974,761.923,N/A,And so my pitch to you is that why I believe that spiderwebs are the most underappreciated thing you'll find on the trail.
763.574,767.804,N/A,are branched differently than something else.
767.824,770.49,N/A,And we keep moving around our groupings.
771.372,773.998,N/A,"And that would be a way, maybe even a word bank."
774.379,778.188,N/A,One of these groupings will be pinning first of all mains.
778.288,779.912,N/A,Pinning may be our process.
782.272,786.919,N/A,Maybe by deduction because we understand what a palm looks like.
786.94,791.126,N/A,We can figure that out once we cross out some of the simpler possibilities.
791.827,798.538,N/A,So I think maybe you could iterate on something like that and get to a really fun sorting kind of activity.
800.762,801.162,N/A,Thank you.
801.363,805.87,N/A,Yeah.
806.451,808.414,N/A,"We were just saying we,"
809.052,817.482,N/A,"I tried to, we wanted to take something we already did in class and turn it more from into teaching into observation and exploration."
818.343,828.995,N/A,"And so instead of like saying, this is Loeb, well this one's tricky because it's sassafras, let's not use that one."
829.015,832.819,N/A,"Loeb versus Smood, well I can't tell, that's actually Sarah."
833.18,835.903,N/A,"Anyway, instead of just naming it and showing them,"
836.255,840.781,N/A,Letting them do kind of like what we did yesterday with the hula hoops.
840.801,843.826,N/A,And them start categorizing on their own.
843.846,848.152,N/A,"What is it that you're, what's similar, what's different?"
849.073,853.499,N/A,And starting to teach the vocabulary of simple versus calm down.
853.519,855.802,N/A,Sari versus smooth versus low.
856.143,857.445,N/A,All that vocabulary.
858.046,861.25,N/A,Let them start piecing together.
861.23,864.355,N/A,what the terms mean by looking at what's similar.
864.375,866.798,N/A,What a whole leaf means.
866.819,866.919,N/A,Yeah.
866.939,871.786,N/A,"Because typically kids will be like, oh, that's a leaf, that's a leaf, that's, you know, like one leaf."
871.806,873.729,N/A,"And that's a leaf and trying to un, yeah."
873.769,883.584,N/A,"But if we give them the branch, maybe they can start looking at counter, like, oh, well, this has a bigger, simpler bottom when a leaf starts."
883.604,887.49,N/A,"But anyway, we're just trying to think of how, instead of just teaching,"
887.47,902.172,N/A,How can they start exploring that and learning that and comparing that on their own?
905.172,910.78,N/A,And they really get to know where they live by school grounds.
910.8,915.006,N/A,We're lucky to have a lot of biodiversity in our trees.
915.026,916.529,N/A,We're a class one arboretum.
916.989,918.171,N/A,Where's your school?
918.191,920.394,N/A,"Bearden High School, where Sam's Club is."
921.396,926.303,N/A,"I know, it's interesting that you have an arboretum and you're going to buy all those plazas."
926.283,927.886,N/A,"Yeah, it's amazing."
927.926,928.768,N/A,We're very fortunate.
928.889,931.634,N/A,And we haven't even used the trees that are in the woodlot.
931.875,933.538,N/A,We have three and a half acre woodlot.
933.558,933.719,N/A,Really?
933.739,938.268,N/A,We haven't even used a single tree in there as arboretum.
938.288,939.972,N/A,That's all school property?
943.529,945.853,N/A,So that's what our idea is.
946.475,948.158,N/A,Did you say 300 acres?
948.398,950.041,N/A,"No, three and a half acres."
950.142,951.324,N/A,It's very small.
951.524,952.266,N/A,Yeah.
952.326,953.328,N/A,"No, I wish."
953.348,955.652,N/A,That would be amazing.
955.712,958.097,N/A,Three and a half acres.
958.237,960.762,N/A,Got to clarify though.
