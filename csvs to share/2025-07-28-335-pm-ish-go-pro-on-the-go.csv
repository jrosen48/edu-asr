25.107,31.598,N/A,we'll hear from half of our room that we think that faster water is better at supporting wine.
31.618,35.044,N/A,"Others say, no, this is why life gets swept downstream."
35.064,39.231,N/A,We think slower water is better at sustaining wine.
39.251,45.782,N/A,"That's a question we have a low amount of confidence in our thinking so far, but the more data we can"
61.709,64.598,N/A,"As I said though, we are gonna spend the bulk of our time."
147.333,148.314,N/A,"Real quick, sorry."
149.096,151.079,N/A,You might notice David wearing this funny contraption.
151.139,152.821,N/A,This was Amanda's idea.
152.881,153.603,N/A,I'll blame Amanda.
154.043,159.271,N/A,She thought it'd be really interesting to capture some first-person footage of your efforts.
159.291,162.757,N/A,"So if anyone's interested in wearing the second one, volunteers are welcome."
162.777,165.28,N/A,You can look as cool as David looks right now.
165.501,169.327,N/A,"So if you're interested, you can just meet me over there, or you can just head off and follow Grace."
171.73,172.672,N/A,"Anyway, thanks, Grace."
172.692,172.952,N/A,Thank you.
173.012,173.593,N/A,No problem.
180.998,181.339,N/A,Yes.

199.305,204.593,N/A,Man.
209.939,231.5,N/A,He's doing his nature notebook stuff.
237.566,237.786,N/A,Yeah.
242.525,246.168,N/A,I mentioned I wish I had a bicycle and floor showed up the next week.
246.188,247.289,N/A,Oh my gosh.
248.831,251.573,N/A,Is this all we do?
251.854,255.017,N/A,"Yeah, that's all you do."
255.137,257.539,N/A,It's supposed to be more like this though.
258.88,259.12,N/A,You're good?
259.14,260.281,N/A,Wow.
260.301,260.822,N/A,Did you miss?
261.703,262.143,N/A,Am I good?
262.604,263.244,N/A,"Yeah, I got you."
263.284,265.206,N/A,But you're a little over spray with that.
265.266,267.168,N/A,There you go.
267.188,267.989,N/A,"All right, next."
269.39,270.591,N/A,You are good to go.
271.297,294.942,N/A,I'm getting all this footage Man that's like right out of a late 80s film
303.562,305.184,N/A,"Actually, I got that in film, I think."
308.79,319.687,N/A,"We should make, we should revise that, edit that back to a 2025 film at Tremont."
322.151,327.038,N/A,"We should do that phonology thing at our schools, Jen, nature notebook stuff."
327.507,334.218,N/A,"Yeah, the kids just go out and look at the tree, and they help identify when trees bloom seasonally."
334.238,335.921,N/A,It goes into a huge database.
337.183,338.225,N/A,Matt could hook you up with it.
339.567,340.208,N/A,It's so easy.
340.669,342.532,N/A,And you've got the freedom to do stuff.
342.552,344.455,N/A,You could do it every quarter when you have new students.
345.918,347.08,N/A,"Oh, man."
349.203,349.684,N/A,How to what?
356.583,358.807,N/A,Look at all this name game stuff.
360.369,384.447,N/A,Beats me.
386.013,392.282,N/A,"I don't know, I intended on doing it with Catherine like four years ago and Max showed us how to do it, he brought us up here."
392.302,394.545,N/A,And then we never did it.
394.565,404.038,N/A,I think environmental club.
404.457,407.541,N/A,That could be something that Anne does.
407.982,409.744,N/A,Did you do the lichen thing?
409.945,410.325,N/A,Not yet.
410.345,411.106,N/A,With his?
411.126,411.947,N/A,"Ruth, that's really cool."
411.967,419.598,N/A,We were hoping to in the next year and I was just saying to Annie that I need to go print out a bunch more flyers.
419.998,431.494,N/A,I was really glad that y'all didn't have to pilot it because I felt like I figured out what I wasn't ready to explain and yeah.
432.014,451.137,N/A,We used to have like a lichen plot set.
452.77,465.143,N/A,"There was a teacher named Justin Reed who started participating in UTK, like in teacher outreach study thing, set this whole thing up."
465.163,467.025,N/A,"Then he went to Taiwan, moved to Taiwan."
467.626,468.767,N/A,His wife's Taiwanese.
469.228,476.095,N/A,"And that was the same summer that the school decided to build or renovate the baseball field, tore all the stuff up."
493.574,495.417,N/A,"Yeah, it'd be cool to go to a purchase knob, too."
495.457,506.492,N/A,"I think those kind of things I want to activate the environmental club to do, because it just is, I never know what class it takes somewhere."
507.052,513.161,N/A,"Because I'd have these three different courses, and they never really overlap."
514.102,516.425,N/A,But I actually could take anyone anywhere.
518.909,519.97,N/A,How many kids do you have in your environmental club?
520.827,527.643,N/A,"I don't know, in the beginning of the year, last year it was like 60, but then at the end of the year it was like 10."
527.663,534.6,N/A,"One time I had Mack Post lead a hike at Imes, and it was like a day where Colleen needed the car, we only had one car at this point."
535.424,564.486,N/A,and I rode my bike to school and I had a meeting right after school and I had a bike to Imes but I was like way too hot so I biked home grabbed the car and drove to Imes because I was so late I couldn't find him I could hear him and I knew Mac liked being in the Hickory Forest so I did the Hickory Forest trail and it turns out Mac wanted to do the Hickory Forest trail but thought it would be too like buggy so he went to a different trail and I bumped into him at the end and he was hiking with like over 60 kids just Mac and the kids yes
564.787,565.608,N/A,It was terrible.
570.157,573.022,N/A,"Well, I don't think they were."
573.042,574.645,N/A,One of them was climbing up on the rocks.
575.647,577.31,N/A,"Yes, it was not good."
577.33,587.368,N/A,"And like yeah, you know Mac like he's like his demeanor is so quiet."
587.585,592.791,N/A,He's one of those people that sometimes is so smart that he doesn't realize that other people don't understand it.
592.811,593.672,N/A,Yes.
593.692,597.056,N/A,He came and talked to our national sleep participants.
597.076,601.161,N/A,"And after their word, they were like, wow, I didn't understand a word."
601.382,601.782,N/A,Right?
601.862,604.565,N/A,He either.
604.585,606.247,N/A,I was an English major.
606.267,607.829,N/A,He did a really good job.
607.849,608.69,N/A,I'm an English major.
609.111,615.178,N/A,Lesson on using dichotomous keys to identify trees during the city nature challenge.
615.614,618.217,N/A,"And my husband and I went, and there were a few other people."
619.498,621.16,N/A,And it was so good.
621.641,624.023,N/A,He was so good at it.
624.604,627.767,N/A,"It wasn't just like, OK, this is the name of a tree moving on."
628.068,631.892,N/A,It was so more nuanced and informative.
631.912,638.459,N/A,Where he lost us was about the biochemistry of carbon sequestration.
638.72,639.921,N/A,"Oh, that's his jam."
640.001,641.883,N/A,I got nothing there.
642.184,643.545,N/A,That's his research right there.
645.348,646.93,N/A,something he knows so well.
648.371,656.541,N/A,He thought some things were in the common understanding that were totally new to the people who happened to be in the room.
666.011,669.415,N/A,But he's so wonderful that no one wanted to tell him.
679.553,679.833,N/A,Hey.
682.676,683.637,N/A,"You're going, Grayson?"
689.163,689.423,N/A,All right.
692.987,694.468,N/A,"They're going to this after you, sir."
694.708,695.089,N/A,All right.
698.472,709.003,N/A,I'd rather carry two things than one thing.
710.873,713.177,N/A,"Yeah, I think so."
713.678,714.739,N/A,I also brought a wetsuit.
717.644,718.766,N/A,We should go out after dinner.
720.649,721.831,N/A,We could just float a little bit.
731.026,735.413,N/A,I did that butterfly survey in early July up here by Cades Cove.
736.334,737.556,N/A,"And on the way back,"
738.245,742.33,N/A,"I was just floating off of one of the, I pulled off to the side, I had never done that before."
742.35,747.536,N/A,"I just pulled off on the side and I was hanging out in the water right off the road, I had my snorkel stuff."
748.056,748.957,N/A,Saw some cool fish.
753.722,754.043,N/A,Over here?
754.083,756.185,N/A,"Oh, you got a spot then."
758.428,763.474,N/A,Cool.
763.494,767.458,N/A,Is that why you were here the other day?
768.805,789.901,N/A,How do you feel about this trout unlimited thing they do?
792.526,793.227,N/A,You know they like
797.881,805.872,N/A,"Yeah, well I think like, I don't know, the website says like brook or rainbow, but I think they predominantly just do rainbow."
807.274,822.455,N/A,"And I was like, I went to Xingli's PD this summer, in the early summer, and it was aquatic, what was it called, like fishy climate, it was like aquatic biology and climate change focus, and a bunch of teachers were doing it."
824.037,827.061,N/A,"I was like, I'm so skeptical."
827.21,828.431,N/A,"No, it was just past June."
829.833,838.702,N/A,"They do a lot of the releases for trout in the classrooms around the Y. And it would make sense that they would, if they have rainbow trout, put them down there."
838.722,839.543,N/A,"What, the YMCA?"
839.983,841.465,N/A,"No, the Y down here."
841.585,842.846,N/A,"Oh, down here."
842.866,844.007,N/A,"Yeah, because that's where people fish."
845.429,852.216,N/A,It's also essentially the habitat and the smokies is divided by elevation.
852.236,856.44,N/A,"So one of the lowest areas in the park, there are no brook trout."
856.555,858.177,N/A,There's less competition.
859.558,883.862,N/A,That's why I was thinking it would be a terrible idea to grow these in the classroom and release them to compete with the brook trout.
886.846,891.495,N/A,which I think is probably not a completely natural division.
892.176,902.555,N/A,It's an effect of in the 50s when the park hadn't really thought things through and they stopped with rainbow trout and then they out competed in the low elk.
902.575,906.362,N/A,"Oh, we're only going to this little like bubbly creek over here, huh?"
906.622,907.704,N/A,"Oh, I brought my snorkel."
908.586,909.107,N/A,Dang.
912.023,913.245,N/A,Is it deep right now?
913.305,918.754,N/A,"No, we're going to be in about maybe two inches of water."
918.794,923.041,N/A,And that's where you find most of our salamanders.
923.081,924.744,N/A,Unless you're snorkeling for hellbenders.
926.707,928.851,N/A,Deeper water is less successful.
939.58,947.432,N/A,I wonder too if we focus on doing something like that we could see in Tremont that'd be even cooler.
947.852,963.175,N/A,We do it in the class and could bring it here and like observe it in nature like what if it was what's that?
970.681,990.597,N/A,this is our street yeah i've been here before should have known actually last time i was here it was with mac and he got real sentimental over the cemetery over there he knew like the whole history and the people who were living there
1007.654,1024.465,N/A,yep not happening got a salamander moving fast never seen him jump that much
1025.288,1030.697,N/A,I don't think I've ever seen a salamander go that fast or jump that high.
1031.097,1032.359,N/A,He's inspired to live.
1033.301,1036.105,N/A,He's inspired to learn.
1036.165,1037.267,N/A,He just wants to escape us.
1037.307,1038.369,N/A,There he goes.
1038.389,1041.113,N/A,And learn how to evade human gravel.
1041.133,1042.716,N/A,"He's like, I'm just going to hit her back."
1043.257,1044.919,N/A,They're coming.
1044.939,1047.423,N/A,They're coming.
1049.266,1051.009,N/A,"All right, crew, so cleansing."
1051.029,1052.832,N/A,"Here's my paper, probably."
1053.233,1065.235,N/A,I have to tell you a little bit about protocol before we begin so that we are all on the same page about how we can capture our salamanders with the least stress to these really sensitive organisms.
1065.485,1072.156,N/A,We know that being captured and studied is probably a traumatic experience.
1072.176,1075.561,N/A,We can tell from all these people who have alien abduction stories.
1076.703,1080.549,N/A,"Not a lot of fun on the end of the specimen being studied, probably."
1081.03,1086.499,N/A,But we can be careful about the ways that we process these experiences.
1086.519,1090.125,N/A,That is the least stress possible for our salamanders as we're learning from them.
1091.287,1097.418,N/A,"And as you likely already know, salamanders are very sensitive organisms."
1097.438,1106.393,N/A,One of the reasons they're so sensitive is because they don't breathe through internal lungs in the same way that we mammals do.
1106.413,1110.961,N/A,They perform gas exchange through the medium of their skin.
1110.981,1114.527,N/A,Every part of the salamander is
1115.755,1120.543,N/A,and gas exchange opportunity.
1120.563,1137.409,N/A,"And so it's really important for us to make sure that we are not contaminating the salamander skin with any of the oils or contaminants on our skin, which could be sanitizer or soap or a little bit of salt from the snack you just ate."
1142.992,1146.377,N/A,"scientific equipment, a Ziploc bag."
1146.397,1149.941,N/A,And you'll notice that each Ziploc bag has a number on it.
1149.961,1152.465,N/A,I'm holding number one right now.
1152.485,1166.203,N/A,"When I go to start my survey, I'm going to have a buddy who is going to be my salamander-puppy partner."
1166.224,1168.887,N/A,And we might negotiate between us who is going to be flipping up the rock and who's going to be holding the bag.
1169.929,1171.19,N/A,"Of course, you can keep rotating those rolls as well."
1171.21,1172.492,N/A,"So John, would you like to lift this black rock here?"
1172.725,1173.826,N/A,Yeah.
1173.846,1182.115,N/A,"If we are getting ready to lift a rock, we want to have our bag down low ready to press against the ground so if there's something under there it doesn't run under the bag."
1182.636,1182.876,N/A,You ready?
1183.137,1183.417,N/A,Ready.
1183.677,1185.239,N/A,Okay.
1185.259,1185.659,N/A,"Oh, look."
1187.221,1187.401,N/A,Wow.
1187.421,1188.943,N/A,We actually got it on our rock.
1188.963,1190.865,N/A,There he is.
1191.065,1194.229,N/A,We have a great example of Orange China Gecko.
1194.669,1197.973,N/A,This is printed on the bottom of this guy.
1198.24,1208.371,N/A,"We're going to put down our bag, and then using something soft, like a little leaf or something, we can tickle the tail of our little friend and get it to run into our bag."
1208.912,1210.513,N/A,"Yes, we got it."
1210.533,1212.135,N/A,It seldom happens that easily.
1213.356,1218.162,N/A,"A lot of them are going to get away because they're small and they're fast and they're brown, and you lose track of them."
1218.782,1227.792,N/A,"If there had been nothing under our rock, we would simply put the rock back gently in the same place that it was, not flinging it through the creek to hit someone else."
1228.379,1234.226,N/A,"But because we have our salamander in the bag, we're going to make sure that it's got a little bit of water."
1234.566,1243.697,N/A,I like to say maybe a fingernail worth of water in that bag with our salamander so it can stay moist and slimy for optimum gas exchange.
1243.717,1246.52,N/A,Zip this bag back up.
1246.54,1250.405,N/A,You don't have to worry about it because it's got oxygen from the bag as well as from the water.
1251.306,1254.91,N/A,And then we're going to bring this number one bag
1255.177,1279.868,N/A,"salamander and water intact back to our base where I'm going to have some pool water in this bin to place the salamander still zipped into its bag inside and exchange it for the number one foam, which is going to be placed in the same spot we found our salamander."
1286.024,1295.612,N/A,Some rules about our salamander survey.
1295.879,1299.524,N/A,are that only one salamander can ever go in that bag.
1299.764,1305.932,N/A,"So even if you find it next to three of its siblings, only one gets to go inside the bag."
1306.453,1308.876,N/A,The bag is only used for one salamander.
1308.896,1315.385,N/A,"So if you have a salamander captured in your bag, you cannot dump them out and be like, no, I'm going for a bigger one."
1315.405,1323.415,N/A,That could transfer the germs like the rhinovirus that we've already taken into account.
1323.495,1323.996,N/A,"Additionally,"
1324.229,1328.934,N/A,Recommend that you not flip rocks that are bigger than your own head.
1329.915,1334.3,N/A,And just be a little bit careful of your feet as you're moving through the stream.
1334.781,1350.338,N/A,"Sometimes we have a habit of jumping rock to rock, but since we know those rocks are also places salamanders prefer to be under, you might choose instead to just go ahead and accept your wet feet and stand in the space in between rocks."
1350.655,1356.861,N/A,feeding those rocks in the pockets of air under them as good salamander habitat.
1356.881,1376.241,N/A,We're going to establish some simple boundaries that'll be from the fallen logs across our stream all the way up to where the left fork of the stream ends in the bank and an approximate drawing and
1381.79,1386.319,N/A,about 50 yards upstream with both forks open for searching.
1387.121,1392.191,N/A,We're going to take about 20 to 25 minutes for this search.
