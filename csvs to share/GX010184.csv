37.679,44.453,N/A,"So Josh, is the goal to have a place-based curriculum ready for 2033?"
46.638,48.843,N/A,That's our next adoption.
49.644,53.713,N/A,"2033, so it's eight years."
77.622,79.846,N/A,"But in eight years, I think you could do a curriculum."
80.226,82.77,N/A,"Like, I think it would be good to sell one to all of Tennessee."
83.432,95.471,N/A,"Well, and if you could integrate them with chemistry and biology, they're all going to be readopted in 2033."
97.635,101.301,N/A,And I think place-based education is good for the kids.
101.551,105.215,N/A,But we're going towards these storyline-based things.
105.415,112.423,N/A,"The problems that we have is they don't have a lot of labs in them, the one that we purchased, which is making the kids actually get out and do less."
119.15,120.231,N/A,But they're doing less.
120.251,122.254,N/A,It's all paperwork.
122.834,125.297,N/A,And that's not good for kids.
276.46,276.903,N/A,I got it.
276.924,278.536,N/A,I just had the wrong thing selected.
279.181,280.632,N/A,Like I know I knew how to do this.
373.762,376.515,N/A,Okay.
434.613,437.437,N/A,collaboration in co-design?
438.838,450.233,N/A,Can you just swap them?
453.077,457.603,N/A,"No, no, no, we're not staying in the friendship circle."
458.224,460.567,N/A,Yes.
460.587,463.911,N/A,"Yeah, we're going into a river."
464.093,467.317,N/A,"Which, but I mean."
467.357,471.121,N/A,Leave the poncho behind and just commit to it.
471.242,473.704,N/A,And just go swimming.
475.607,487.581,N/A,Multiple times this week I've gotten that little pew pew.
487.641,489.984,N/A,"We're high enough in the mountains, we're not."
490.004,490.945,N/A,We're uphill.
543.727,546.852,N/A,So those lab safety things were driving me nuts.
546.872,549.416,N/A,"The day I was doing it, it kept on click."
549.476,559.091,N/A,"I'm like, I got to the point where I took a picture of the answer that I put and then pushed submit because I couldn't get one to stay."
559.131,565.341,N/A,And I submitted my answer and them telling me that it was the right answer because I could only get a 90 on that one.
565.361,566.663,N/A,I think it's like number three.
571.081,591.098,N/A,However many times you have to take it to get 100 but made me look like an idiot that I took it four times to try to get this 100 when I was getting it right every time.
623.933,639.141,N/A,I had them make the graph that the data table together and then I put it in
674.862,675.363,N/A,"Okay, that's cool."
675.623,677.266,N/A,"That's cool, art and data, okay, that's cool."
678.869,687.724,N/A,"How many of you, I know some of you used it last year, how many of you used Code App at all with the students before?"
687.744,690.629,N/A,"This last year, Jen last year, cool."
691.971,694.035,N/A,"Any other tools that you've used around,"
705.727,710.421,N/A,"Yeah, it's easy for them to get lost."
752.842,759.105,N/A,know what we get.
798.185,799.269,N/A,I'm super energetic.
848.843,852.889,N/A,"Allison was asking about Excel, but kids don't have it."
852.909,853.25,N/A,Right.
853.27,857.356,N/A,And very similar to Google Sheets.
857.376,857.897,N/A,Pretty much.
859.118,860.781,N/A,Google's getting there.
860.861,861.923,N/A,Google's trying to get there.
862.063,864.506,N/A,"It's the shortcuts that's different, really."
864.526,865.468,N/A,Shortcuts.
865.848,870.656,N/A,"But you can input your own shortcuts into Google Sheets, though."
871.557,874.782,N/A,So it's pretty useful.
874.802,874.902,N/A,Yeah.
951.376,955.058,N/A,"So how about this, if you wanna go."
981.312,995.288,N/A,It's all going in there all that just makes my soul happy
997.478,998.199,N/A,I love that.
998.339,998.94,N/A,Right?
998.96,1000.783,N/A,And then so they could all see it.
1000.803,1006.752,N/A,"Like, if your grade band was all studying, like, you want our butterflies, everybody goes out on this day."
1006.792,1009.476,N/A,"That's crazy, Mom."
1009.596,1010.538,N/A,Yeah.
1010.558,1017.889,N/A,But if you had a curriculum that we all shared that Tennessee adopted that was play-spaced and data-driven.
1018.89,1022.075,N/A,They should be able to fit it in there if they wanted to.
1022.416,1022.796,N/A,Right?
1024.319,1025.6,N/A,"Like, think about storylines."
1025.901,1027.283,N/A,Everybody's doing it.
1029.659,1032.462,N/A,We could make this more interactive.
1032.482,1034.624,N/A,And it doesn't matter if you're inner city.
1035.285,1039.91,N/A,You're representing the city demographic.
1040.01,1045.295,N/A,"And you can, whatever bugs, you identify everything that you see that day at your school."
1045.315,1046.897,N/A,And so does every other school.
1047.217,1049.119,N/A,"And then the next day, everybody goes back."
1050.681,1057.928,N/A,"And you could see the difference between Farragut and West, or Farragut and Nashville,"
1062.481,1072.062,N/A,He said that wasn't part of his plan.
1072.564,1073.666,N/A,Just giving resources.
1073.686,1078.617,N/A,Want to write a curriculum?
1082.343,1090.232,N/A,But a series of Tennessee wants to adopt something that a new teacher can just pick up.
1091.033,1096.28,N/A,Which is scripted and it's killing me.
1096.4,1097.141,N/A,Poor Allison.
1097.361,1099.704,N/A,She came to the opening training with me.
1099.724,1101.986,N/A,"And she's like, doesn't that take all the art out of teaching?"
1102.046,1104.79,N/A,"And I'm like, I feel so good."
1104.87,1110.156,N/A,I graduated from UT in December of 2022.
1110.136,1115.035,N/A,So I came in right whenever they were wrapping up the standards that we were on board.
1115.055,1118.087,N/A,"And I was like, oh, so this is what it's like to be a teacher."
1120.379,1122.562,N/A,"Well, I moved here two years ago."
1122.582,1123.863,N/A,They gave us pre-AP.
1124.825,1127.128,N/A,And so I was the first one to teach it.
1127.508,1129.591,N/A,I went through it all.
1129.611,1132.535,N/A,"I added things in for the implementation, lined up all the notes."
1132.995,1135.318,N/A,And then they go and change editions.
1135.338,1136.92,N/A,And this one's so scripted.
1137.08,1140.545,N/A,And the stuff we learn here is so cool.
1140.705,1144.51,N/A,And to not be able to implement any of it hurts.
1144.73,1146.252,N/A,So I'm in mornings.
1152.222,1165.216,N/A,But I think this group could write a group.
1165.316,1170.002,N/A,And write one that went from middle school through high school.
1170.062,1175.007,N/A,So what you do builds on what we do.
1180.201,1182.103,N/A,Like they're doing all this research.
1182.143,1184.206,N/A,I feel like it should go into curriculum planning.
1197.201,1203.008,N/A,And I agree that it should just be lessons to implement that all go together.
1203.028,1209.516,N/A,"I mean, I like the idea of a phenomenon that leads all the instruction and the kids finding out things and problem-based learning."
1212.027,1216.773,N/A,"to like the science of the moment, like what the kids asked."
1216.913,1220.477,N/A,Like there's no leeway in what we've got right now.
1222.28,1228.347,N/A,"And I swear if they'd chosen to stickleback fish, like my kids would want to like jump off the bridge."
1228.367,1232.512,N/A,"Because six weeks talking about a stickleback fish, we can't leave."
1232.733,1240.262,N/A,"I have like 15 lessons worth, and there's sometimes more than one day for each lesson about bath bombs."
1244.866,1262.993,N/A,Getting them through the full period.
1275.19,1279.799,N/A,there goes a little too much into it.
1280.42,1285.029,N/A,"A lot of these kids already know what an atom is, or they know what molecules are."
1285.67,1291.14,N/A,"Whenever we're talking about platforms, we have to sit there and not say the word atom or molecule."
1298.09,1317.972,N/A,It's word we earn.
1328.38,1328.801,N/A,Kitem.
1330.082,1339.316,N/A,"Kitem has organized all of our content into one platform, but it's all of the sci-ed stuff, like storylines and everything."
1342.641,1347.788,N/A,"But they've just organized it into Kitem, and we're supposed to be getting these workbooks for them to work out of."
1347.808,1352.515,N/A,And I...
1357.456,1361.34,N/A,that they were going to be giving us them.
1364.083,1371.13,N/A,My thing is I would like to see it now and they haven't given us a copy of what the students will look like.
1372.191,1378.978,N/A,All I have is two teachers editions for the first unit and the second unit.
1378.998,1383.042,N/A,They haven't given us anything else.
1393.417,1395.563,N/A,think it's just
1429.546,1432.186,N/A,They really enjoy seventh grade science.
1432.207,1435.27,N/A,That's where you see a lot of their growth.
1501.822,1511.798,N/A,Wednesday the other two science teachers from my grade at my school are meeting
1584.728,1587.432,N/A,He's the one that keeps sneaking in little projects.
1587.452,1588.553,N/A,"I'm like, stop it, man."
1588.593,1590.315,N/A,"He's just a little scattered, I think."
1590.676,1591.096,N/A,Yeah.
1591.557,1593.119,N/A,He's got a seven-year-old kid.
1594.681,1595.302,N/A,"I mean, I get it."
1595.462,1596.463,N/A,I met him during.
1596.564,1598.106,N/A,"I was still like, seriously?"
1598.126,1598.466,N/A,Come on.
1598.486,1601.17,N/A,Just open them all up at the beginning of the semester.
1601.29,1605.816,N/A,"And the other teacher I have, I opened them all up, but she has a really strict policy."
1606.016,1606.737,N/A,You can turn it.
1612.167,1620.884,N/A,"Do them all ahead of time, just don't submit them."
1621.465,1629.822,N/A,You would also probably enjoy their fishy climate training.
1731.271,1748.233,N/A,Drag it over to Nick's new because it's gigantic and I don't
1770.758,1776.079,N/A,He's just gonna accumulate stuff.
1776.38,1779.452,N/A,"So yeah, take the time, drag everything you don't use."
1884.378,1893.568,N/A,"I don't really have an idea who this is, but what I love, and I say this to my staff, is the norms are great, and almost everybody can come up with a good set of norms."
1894.87,1904.4,N/A,"The living within those norms is tricky, because oftentimes, and one of our usual norms is, take ownership over the impacts that you have."
1904.741,1909.626,N/A,"And usually everyone's like, of course I do that, but you don't always know the impacts that you have."
1910.18,1916.97,N/A,"And sometimes you can hurt somebody's feelings, never know that you did, because you certainly didn't intend to."
1917.511,1922.218,N/A,But something you said or a way that you said it caught somebody wrong.
1923.44,1926.044,N/A,"And in those moments, you'd never know."
1926.124,1932.113,N/A,"Like the person would be hurt, the person who did it would never know, and we'd all go on, and the system remains the same."
1933.035,1938.583,N/A,"But in our situation, and what I like about our staff and what I like about this group already is,"
1940.15,1950.968,N/A,"sharing that sense that I got my feelings stepped on, or this happened and I just wanted to bring it up."
1950.988,1952.27,N/A,So it came to me.
1952.791,1956.357,N/A,"And so I just want us to know, this stuff is happening."
1956.898,1959.182,N/A,"And we don't mean it, and we don't intend it, typically."
1961.025,1961.466,N/A,So.
1973.545,1985.091,N/A,Really focus on how we respond to things how we talk about things language that we use and
1993.846,1995.189,N/A,Don't sit there.
1995.249,1996.011,N/A,Don't suffer.
1996.071,2001.204,N/A,"Don't think, oh, it's just because of this or that, or they didn't mean it, so I'm just not going to say anything."
2001.244,2002.787,N/A,"If you had that moment, just say it."
2002.807,2006.296,N/A,"I mean, this is probably the most friendly group of people you're going to work with."
2006.476,2009.002,N/A,"I mean, these are people that really want to do the best by everybody."
2009.784,2010.546,N/A,So this is how we learn.
2011.107,2012.31,N/A,And this is what happens in classrooms.
2024.305,2029.578,N/A,"We're going to be working together all afternoon, all evening, tomorrow, and then hopefully later on after we leave here."
2029.598,2032.304,N/A,And I want everybody to feel good about ourselves.
2032.324,2035.211,N/A,"This is not like, this is not John's calling somebody else."
2035.291,2039.682,N/A,"He's just recognizing that somewhere along the line, we didn't quite live up to our boundaries."
2050.681,2055.447,N/A,"But maybe, I mean, we may spend a little more time even in the next couple of days just unpacking, like what does this look like?"
2055.467,2057.11,N/A,What does this look like when it doesn't happen?
2057.13,2061.776,N/A,Have you ever had it happen that you got something hurt and the person didn't know?
2061.796,2063.718,N/A,They didn't know?
2065.561,2066.983,N/A,Were you able to bring it up?
2067.003,2069.266,N/A,Was there enough safety there to bring something?
2069.286,2070.568,N/A,Like that's tricky.
2070.588,2073.972,N/A,I'm just glad to know that this is that kind of place.
2073.992,2075.935,N/A,So these are sitting over there.
2076.375,2077.617,N/A,We wrote them down.
2111.887,2135.346,N/A,What time do you think that will end up being?
2159.66,2162.515,N/A,We'll take another look at the weather then.
