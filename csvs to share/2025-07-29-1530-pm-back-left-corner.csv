0.183,5.289,N/A,I'll give you this whole like simulation water thing.
7.131,11.597,N/A,I'll find the website and it's young too.
12.177,28.857,N/A,It doesn't really matter because they just need to follow each other.
29.208,31.473,N/A,The term might still follow each other.
31.493,36.244,N/A,Each one that walks is then reinforcing a pheromone.
38.128,39.271,N/A,Where they walk the circle.
40.213,42.238,N/A,Oh here it is.
42.258,47.149,N/A,Now this one's kind of useful.
49.272,71.955,N/A,"I'm impressed you guys can still like think and work hard after Okay, that's how I would feel"
97.433,98.702,N/A,We've already started.
186.55,202.855,N/A,I don't know.
300.085,305.656,N/A,S04 where it talks about how matter and energy moves within an ecosystem.
305.676,313.672,N/A,It looks like they're looking at maybe water quality.
313.692,317.419,N/A,"They're talking about oxygen levels, fertilizers."
363.721,367.285,N/A,I'm looking at Fatima's potato or tomato plant.
420.168,432.946,N/A,"And even if, like, if we had data on this water source that we know is gross, could we compare it to our water source?"
432.966,437.552,N/A,"So have this data, but then also take our own data."
437.613,441.578,N/A,"Well, how does it compare to this one that we know?"
441.919,448.588,N/A,"And then the NGSS, it is the fish dying in the pond, which is under LPSO4."
458.913,485.663,N/A,"The data is either decreased, increased, increased, decreased, so."
486.25,500.142,N/A,But I wonder if we could find a different data set about a pond that's undergoing eutrophication and then compare it to another pond.
827.243,833.892,N/A,"I haven't looked through all of it yet, but there's one in Dated Nuggets called Love That Dirty Water."
835.855,856.002,N/A,"And it's about losing green spaces and putting in homes and businesses, and that essentially, without those green spaces, you lose a lot of natural filtration of the water, and so you end up with more human waste and toxic materials in the water."
855.982,869.468,N/A,"So I wonder if we could think about how and if our waterways connect and look at this, compare our"
894.119,917.402,N/A,"I haven't actually looked at the data for this, so I don't know what there is, what they're looking at."
917.502,924.109,N/A,"They're looking at it as daily flow, which"
933.623,942.132,N/A,that increase in flow would indicate a higher risk that's more likely to have.
1145.084,1150.099,N/A,Thank you.
1347.365,1348.868,N/A,I need a reminder to be a reminder.
1350.07,1350.812,N/A,"Reminder, reminder."
1351.193,1352.956,N/A,I need a reminder to be a reminder.
1352.976,1353.317,N/A,"No, I get it."
1353.337,1355.341,N/A,"And then likewise, I need a reminder to be the reminder."
1355.461,1355.722,N/A,OK.
1357.245,1358.107,N/A,Of the reminder.
1358.187,1360.131,N/A,I'll remind you.
1360.151,1360.411,N/A,"Yeah, thanks."
1360.431,1361.794,N/A,Does it work if it's circular like that?
1361.814,1363.297,N/A,I feel like it drinks that.
1363.317,1364.64,N/A,Like if you remind me to remind you.
1367.025,1368.748,N/A,As long as one of us remembers to remind.
1370.365,1373.434,N/A,I'm never going to remember anything ever again after that.
1375.54,1377.386,N/A,Somebody's got to start it.
1377.446,1380.595,N/A,I'm just realizing that conversation is probably being recorded.
1532.213,1547.86,N/A,The big question of Unit 4 in this particular system is why are so many species declining now while a few seem to be expanding and why does it matter?
1548.741,1552.888,N/A,And it's focused in on coyote populations.
1555.265,1572.841,N/A,"I'm in the BSES curriculum, but I can probably share the focus guide where it has the standards and then it breaks them down down below."
1579.146,1583.23,N/A,Yes.
1583.851,1610.922,N/A,What's your last name again?
1611.239,1639.002,N/A,"Yeah, so I've been looking at lesson, so I'm in unit four, lesson like three, four, six, but it's more like, so this is just like human impact on land use and"
1639.403,1643.63,N/A,"you know, where we've developed and what's been disturbed and that kind of thing."
1646.274,1654.547,N/A,So it has these different scenarios of population growth and carrying capacity.
1657.132,1663.622,N/A,"It doesn't have like the data to go with it, but I think they're"
1663.957,1678.441,N/A,"Again, I haven't gone through all of this, but I think they're, like, looking at this and thinking about, like, what kinds of things might have happened in those situations."
1678.581,1684.11,N/A,"This is talking about studies, like, how do they know where coyotes live?"
1684.13,1685.492,N/A,"So, like, looking at scats."
1693.184,1713.657,N/A,I'm trying to think like could we somehow get local priority data and then also can we look at
1715.645,1725.616,N/A,"you know, kind of looking at just some sort of population study, even like what we did today, of like starting here."
1725.736,1731.763,N/A,"Okay, well now let's look at this population within Knoxville kind of thing."
1732.244,1738.931,N/A,"Right, right."
1739.632,1742.075,N/A,So we sort of practice it that way.
1742.115,1743.897,N/A,This is what scientists do.
1745.48,1754.235,N/A,"and then talk about, OK, well, how do they get that data?"
1754.355,1770.643,N/A,"Right, but thinking about how many"
1780.85,1800.458,N/A,I was just looking through some of the stuff.
1801.94,1804.203,N/A,I haven't really looked at it.
1804.363,1807.768,N/A,"I was just looking to see what kind of data they had, period."
1821.451,1823.299,N/A,You just look weird.
1823.339,1828.963,N/A,Nobody understands what you're doing.
1868.583,1869.624,N/A,"Oh, there it is."
1869.644,1870.065,N/A,"Oh, no."
1870.085,1870.805,N/A,We're back again.
1871.366,1871.807,N/A,"Hey, Bear."
1872.247,1877.733,N/A,I just can't let go of the phone.
1878.033,1879.535,N/A,"OK, just stay right there, Michelle."
1879.555,1883.379,N/A,"Don't judge a picture, really."
1884.3,1885.161,N/A,Excuse me.
1885.201,1886.162,N/A,That's true.
1886.382,1888.625,N/A,"I was like, eh."
1888.645,1889.426,N/A,"Jen, sorry to ask."
1889.446,1891.568,N/A,Do you mind if we flip the lights real quick?
1891.788,1893.41,N/A,It's a little bright.
1893.43,1894.171,N/A,It's over there.
1894.191,1896.694,N/A,I think it's both maps.
1896.714,1897.915,N/A,We're good.
1902.67,1903.651,N/A,"Vincent, I got another."
1903.691,1904.572,N/A,We took like 10.
1904.633,1905.454,N/A,I was.
1905.474,1906.775,N/A,Sorry.
1906.795,1908.157,N/A,"Vincent, you are very important."
1908.177,1910.74,N/A,I'm going to look at the other ones.
1910.881,1911.662,N/A,"Sorry, Vincent."
1912.723,1913.704,N/A,I look surprised.
1913.724,1914.686,N/A,I should have squatted.
1914.866,1916.228,N/A,I thought it was short enough.
1917.569,1919.171,N/A,"I thought you were, too."
1919.252,1919.993,N/A,All right.
1920.173,1921.855,N/A,So we'll look at that.
1921.875,1924.999,N/A,I think we got another couple of good ones.
1967.521,1970.562,N/A,"Sorry, a lot of words here."
2180.77,2185.397,N/A,Why are we doing this?
2185.417,2192.449,N/A,"We were looking even just last night, and some of the footage around the discussions that were had around identifying salamanders were super interesting."
2192.469,2193.51,N/A,It was really cool.
2193.53,2195.774,N/A,"I'm not going to upload it to YouTube, but that'd be a fun YouTube channel, right?"
2195.794,2197.977,N/A,Just watching people look for a salamander.
2197.997,2198.558,N/A,First person.
2199.78,2202.745,N/A,"But no, we don't have permission."
2208.749,2211.807,N/A,"or actually maybe even more than maybe what does work, but I mean, maybe."
2311.687,2312.31,N/A,"Oh, right."
2312.39,2312.852,N/A,"OK, hike."
2312.973,2314.077,N/A,Are you ready for another hike?
2315.142,2315.986,N/A,"No, I don't know about this."
2316.086,2316.87,N/A,I feel kind of sorry.
2316.89,2320.144,N/A,But we didn't do this yesterday because the rain and things got pushed back.
2340.222,2355.289,N/A,"Yeah, it will unless you're really haulin, but you're going up some steep steep places to Enjoy the water and enjoy the foam And relax, that would be like the old vacation where they show up at the Grand Canyon."
2355.309,2361.64,N/A,"He's like, that's great Enjoy the Falls"
2408.768,2411.539,N/A,That was awesome.
2438.57,2442.133,N/A,Thanks for all this stuff today.
2484.217,2485.86,N/A,I knew it was off or not off.
2485.96,2486.881,N/A,I don't mean that.
2486.941,2487.943,N/A,I knew it was different.
2487.963,2488.704,N/A,And it's OK.
2488.805,2493.532,N/A,"I answer to it all because, honestly, it's supposed to be Alicia."
2493.552,2494.474,N/A,It's a Spanish name.
2494.754,2500.083,N/A,But my parents have never told me that.
2500.103,2501.265,N/A,They always tell me it's a Spanish name.
2501.305,2502.287,N/A,They're probably wrong.
2502.427,2504.03,N/A,It's still your name.
2504.05,2506.073,N/A,It's my name.
2518.675,2523.059,N/A,Alicia.
2523.079,2523.62,N/A,It's Alicia.
2523.64,2524.081,N/A,Alicia.
2524.101,2524.561,N/A,I know.
2525.462,2526.563,N/A,We just went over this.
2526.583,2529.486,N/A,"I know, and I've been practicing all day in my head."
2530.067,2531.028,N/A,It's the wrong one.
2532.129,2532.649,N/A,"Oh, I know."
2532.97,2535.672,N/A,"When you practiced the wrong one and practiced it, yeah."
2535.692,2539.396,N/A,I've been writing my notes.
2539.416,2540.317,N/A,Just spell it wrong.
2540.457,2542.299,N/A,Spell it how it sounds.
2543.58,2544.822,N/A,It's Lissa.
2544.922,2545.823,N/A,Oh my god.
2547.304,2548.125,N/A,So rude.
2554.265,2562.001,N/A,"And when I moved out to Albuquerque, and I had students that spelled their name like that, and I said, Alicia, they're like, no."
2562.021,2563.484,N/A,That is not how you say that.
2563.504,2564.566,N/A,"I was like, OK."
2564.746,2565.448,N/A,In LA?
2566.37,2566.951,N/A,Where were you?
2566.971,2568.494,N/A,"In Albuquerque, New Mexico."
2568.534,2568.614,N/A,OK.
2568.634,2569.296,N/A,New Mexico?
2569.656,2569.897,N/A,Yeah.
2569.917,2570.478,N/A,Still.
2570.498,2570.939,N/A,Yeah.
2570.959,2573.825,N/A,I had a student where her name looked like Theresa.
2573.925,2575.328,N/A,"I mean, I grew up in Ohio."
2580.978,2583.563,N/A,Give me a moment.
2583.583,2605.602,N/A,I promise I want to do it right.
2622.237,2625.701,N/A,I'm going to make everybody's name wrong.
2626.462,2629.465,N/A,I had one kid that didn't tell me yesterday.
2629.565,2632.468,N/A,I had one kid that didn't like halfway through the year.
2632.528,2636.913,N/A,"Some kid was like, hey, I'm so close."
2637.754,2641.097,N/A,"And then I was like, dude, why didn't you tell me I was saying your name wrong?"
2641.278,2642.559,N/A,I was doing it on my phone.
2642.779,2645.342,N/A,I just don't care.
2645.963,2647.187,N/A,"I don't care if you care, I care."
2647.227,2652.546,N/A,"I hate when they do that or when it's like, oh, do you go by Thomas or Tommy?"
2652.867,2653.308,N/A,I don't care.
2654.071,2654.794,N/A,"No, don't do that."
2654.814,2655.757,N/A,"No, give me."
2655.877,2658.707,N/A,What do you call your own self?
2661.472,2671.585,N/A,I'm not going to assume a nickname for you because I started a few years ago going around on the first day and having them introduce themselves to me.
2671.746,2673.788,N/A,And that way I can hear what they're saying.
2673.808,2680.057,N/A,The problem is they're suddenly going to go by the name that I'm given and ask them to go by their middle nickname or whatever.
2680.077,2686.305,N/A,But that helps me because then I have my list and I have them tell me who they are.
2686.325,2689.369,N/A,I have them do little tech cards like here.
2689.349,2702.241,N/A,"Put your name with your last name, or whatever you call yourself, with your last name so I can see and face the name together, and I'll eventually get it."
2706.224,2707.365,N/A,Great question.
2707.385,2708.607,N/A,Not 100%.
2708.627,2708.887,N/A,Sure.
2709.908,2711.99,N/A,"By the end of the year, we're going to build."
2712.01,2712.87,N/A,"Yeah, that's right."
2713.051,2715.713,N/A,We're not certain yet.
2715.733,2716.354,N/A,In your email?
2717.134,2717.955,N/A,From Leah.
2720.585,2725.493,N/A,"Lea, Lea."
2725.573,2733.346,N/A,Nobody's getting their name right today.
2733.406,2738.154,N/A,"Is it Mee-hay-ken, or is it just Mee-gen?"
2738.194,2741.039,N/A,"Oh, she's McHann."
2741.099,2743.723,N/A,McHann.
2768.527,2770.605,N/A,I can't get the video to load.
2792.337,2795.482,N/A,"And we were like, that's not a butterfly."
2795.823,2800.089,N/A,"But then she thinks, like, with mosquitoes, she just smashes them."
2800.991,2804.597,N/A,"And so then she was trying to, like, swat at the logs."
2804.877,2811.628,N/A,"And I was like, I made it faster than this problem for myself."
2844.025,2853.502,N/A,It was my biggest fear.
2861.235,2865.062,N/A,We were allowed like just one or two sodas a day.
2865.082,2867.726,N/A,So like you drink a little bit and then like stick it somewhere.
2868.648,2869.189,N/A,We ended
2872.055,2874.539,N/A,"But no, I ended up with a bee in my mouth multiple times."
2875.601,2876.944,N/A,But it never stung my mouth.
2876.964,2877.925,N/A,I just would get it out.
2878.366,2887.482,N/A,"But the worst one was when it came out, it stung me right on the edge of my nose, like that most sensitive spot."
2889.014,2893.364,N/A,"Yeah, this is my biggest fear, because I am allergic to bees."
2893.464,2897.653,N/A,"I've never had respiratory issues, because I've always been stung."
2897.733,2903.125,N/A,"But I swell up like crazy in that area, so that is my biggest fear."
3042.847,3057.109,N/A,I felt like it was like you knew the names of some of those plants out there already
3065.527,3080.548,N/A,I'm not quite sure what you're asking
3080.528,3094.125,N/A,"This survey is very lengthy and having three questions within one prompt, I feel like I'm answering the first question."
3094.225,3097.97,N/A,"And then by the time you're done, that's like 20 questions."
3098.31,3101.334,N/A,Because there are three and four in each question.
3101.554,3104.718,N/A,"It's like just, what is it they're wanting to know?"
3104.798,3105.9,N/A,Let's make it fast.
3106.0,3108.443,N/A,Because exit tickets are so low.
3110.465,3124.12,N/A,the language is very convoluted.
3153.547,3159.521,N/A,I'm so glad you have that video.
3159.942,3163.43,N/A,"Yeah, me too."
3166.357,3168.101,N/A,And he's trying to figure it out himself too.
3168.643,3169.665,N/A,"I'm laughing, what am I doing?"
3251.27,3255.916,N/A,"Get on it, Josh."
3257.218,3265.369,N/A,Don't you think it would be great to have something like BSCS and more labs and more about Tennessee?
3266.691,3273.7,N/A,I think it would be awesome if they had some sort of platform where Renita's class and my class could
3282.202,3296.127,N/A,"like what Hardin Valley has access to, what Farragut has access to, is very different than what a lot of other schools have access to in terms of doing labs, doing activities."
3328.827,3330.029,N/A,I don't know.
3330.109,3337.602,N/A,And maybe I'm a little defensive about it.
3337.622,3339.285,N/A,That's potentially a thing.
3339.726,3341.008,N/A,Because you worked so hard at MBSC.
3341.309,3342.27,N/A,And I'm not well.
3342.591,3343.933,N/A,This is like eight years.
3411.498,3413.492,N/A,"I mean, we've just never, I've never run."
3446.682,3450.887,N/A,"But the question is, do we throw out microscopes that have something wrong with their stage?"
3450.907,3452.328,N/A,"Like, that could totally be fixed."
3452.348,3467.286,N/A,"I taught in the ceiling in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where almost everybody in that school was the kid of somebody working in the Research Triangle in Durham or a professor at UNC."
3468.347,3471.37,N/A,And I was a new teacher there.
3471.57,3476.436,N/A,And the dude who had his class set of microscopes told me I could not use
3485.731,3495.899,N/A,"I'm just saying, like, my experience at Hardin Valley is for sure different than other people's experiences."
3496.019,3500.331,N/A,"We have our microscopes, but then we also have a set of microscopes that are used for the"
3509.761,3524.8,N/A,"That's kind of my thinking is like this potentially, yes, I would love to see as much opportunities for the kids to do as many things as possible."
3527.632,3534.244,N/A,"I do want to say, great conversation."
3534.264,3538.07,N/A,I think the BSES curriculum looks good to me.
3538.13,3539.072,N/A,It could do a lot worse.
3539.112,3540.254,N/A,We made a lot of progress in science ed.
3540.274,3543.7,N/A,This is actually pretty damn good.
3550.7,3567.207,N/A,right right like nobody saying you have to follow the script but when you
3574.375,3576.798,N/A,And I think I agree with you.
3576.818,3580.283,N/A,"It's going to be hard, and there are things that we all love to do."
3580.523,3585.669,N/A,We all have our things that we love that we've done for years and have worked really well.
3585.73,3589.454,N/A,And it's hard to get those things done.
3589.554,3590.335,N/A,"Exactly, right?"
3591.096,3593.279,N/A,We've been talking about it.
3593.319,3597.885,N/A,"We've had $1,200 worth of eye buttons to do the endotherm ER that are just going to be sitting there now."
3598.861,3603.054,N/A,"You know, and so we think about like, okay, what can we do after the EOC?"
3603.214,3605.08,N/A,What can we put in here?
3605.1,3606.103,N/A,What can we do over here?
3606.705,3612.803,N/A,"And I don't know the answer to that, but I don't think I'll know until I've done it at least once, if not."
3622.368,3626.835,N/A,really lucky that I get to try it all out new in that honors class.
3627.015,3637.03,N/A,But I'm also not going to have a good perspective on what it's like to do it in a CP class or what it's like to do it in an included class.
3637.05,3639.834,N/A,"It's just, yeah, so it's just, you know, I don't know."
3639.854,3643.54,N/A,There's just a lot that I don't know what it's going to look like for.
3643.56,3645.162,N/A,"But I understand that, right?"
3645.222,3651.852,N/A,"There's like stuff that we've worked hard on for years and years and years and we've created and we've done and now you're like,"
3668.2,3671.425,N/A,Like it's good in the beginning and then it goes.
3671.445,3673.469,N/A,I like the drawings.
3673.489,3673.769,N/A,Yes.
3674.811,3675.753,N/A,The system drawings.
3675.773,3676.033,N/A,Yeah.
3676.153,3676.915,N/A,I like using that.
3677.536,3688.374,N/A,"And my view of like the curriculum as it is now, it's so much better than those because they've taken all of that like, write that question, write it again, answer it again."
3688.634,3689.656,N/A,Go back and answer it again.
3689.716,3691.138,N/A,"Do it in a different color, right?"
3691.158,3692.841,N/A,"Like all those things where you're like,"
3693.344,3707.59,N/A,We didn't just choose it like I like that
3712.818,3716.364,N/A,from this resource.
3716.384,3718.628,N/A,"Honestly, we were going to be feeling this way no matter what you guys do."
3718.828,3719.349,N/A,Exactly.
3720.131,3723.396,N/A,So it's totally not meant to be at all an attack idea.
3723.456,3726.181,N/A,"I do ask you a lot of questions, because you know."
3726.461,3728.084,N/A,Which is absolutely fine.
3728.104,3730.027,N/A,"I don't know, but at least it knows."
3730.328,3734.455,N/A,I'm not taking it personally when people don't like it.
3734.435,3738.301,N/A,"If you were on the outside, you'd cope with it, right?"
3738.321,3743.77,N/A,"I do have anxiety about it, and I've seen it longer than you guys have seen it."
3743.85,3757.472,N/A,"But I still have anxiety about it, because it's really, like, it is less of that, like, I like to be in control of where I think we're heading, and it's not like that as much, and that gives me anxiety of, like,"
3758.161,3775.579,N/A,Yeah
3783.845,3804.807,N/A,And it has a whole lesson where you actually go back to things in unit one and unit three and relate it all to this ecology stuff that you're doing
3812.228,3817.699,N/A,"OK, so as an AP biology teacher, like I was talking about."
3859.765,3861.947,N/A,Right.
3862.228,3871.237,N/A,"But maybe by a weird teaching, the same topic of it."
3871.317,3873.4,N/A,But it is more in depth.
3873.52,3876.022,N/A,"And again, while you're doing your job."
3876.143,3881.488,N/A,"So if you have, most of the time, I like what you guys remember from respiration."
3881.528,3884.912,N/A,"Like if oxygen and sugar goes in, energy comes out."
3889.229,3891.056,N/A,Fermentation.
3893.366,3900.133,N/A,If I'm lucky.
3925.308,3939.664,N/A,"biological systems, like free energy, molecules, all that, optimization, information storage and transmission, DNA, evolution, natural selection, back to idea one, and system interactions back to biological science."
3939.945,3948.034,N/A,"So those are the four big ideas, and there's two units that kind of go more with one of those big ideas than the others."
3949.515,3951.838,N/A,So we don't really know how this impacts that.
3981.147,3985.066,N/A,We had environmental science.
3985.086,3987.899,N/A,"We had ecology, biology, chemistry for CP."
3988.08,3989.487,N/A,Our parents.
4010.982,4016.52,N/A,right now like this is probably our last
4054.452,4057.156,N/A,programs and things like that to do it for them.
4057.176,4060.24,N/A,"So it's like an in-between to chemistry, so I think it's a good progression."
4060.26,4074.539,N/A,"Well, and it's interesting now because our, I would say our revised standards, and particularly this curriculum, is much less, you know, we used to be pretty bio-penable, right?"
4074.559,4076.141,N/A,With the macromolecules.
4076.161,4080.907,N/A,"The macromolecules, I'm so glad that can go on, yeah."
4080.927,4083.21,N/A,"So, you know, when we started teaching chemistry,"
4090.868,4094.893,N/A,Now are we even getting into Krebs cycle and lactic acid?
4094.913,4100.5,N/A,I haven't looked at the new standards at all.
4100.52,4103.163,N/A,"Well, cellular respiration is one that's outside BSCS."
4103.183,4104.364,N/A,We have to teach.
4104.705,4106.286,N/A,Not completely.
4106.306,4107.388,N/A,It's not completely outside.
4107.408,4110.592,N/A,"There is an addendum to it, but it's not completely."
4110.612,4111.433,N/A,It is in there.
4112.514,4119.562,N/A,"We just felt like it would be good to have a little bit of support, of potential support that people might want."
4119.582,4120.183,N/A,What was I?
4121.193,4123.957,N/A,We're looking at the standards thing.
4126.722,4130.568,N/A,"So with the standards focus, it goes through each of the standards."
4131.589,4135.135,N/A,And then you can click on it.
4135.155,4141.004,N/A,So we're looking.
4141.024,4141.464,N/A,Is this the crosswalk?
4141.484,4142.085,N/A,"No, this is not the crosswalk."
4142.105,4143.167,N/A,This is the more detail-y one.
4143.187,4143.808,N/A,So if we looked at where it is.
4154.065,4178.402,N/A,it and go down and it'll tell you but anyway it breaks it down right does you it tells you like what is this related to previously gives you the big idea of it and then it breaks it down into key science ideas and
4179.8,4185.026,N/A,These came from the state.
4185.046,4185.787,N/A,I think this is coming in two.
4185.987,4191.073,N/A,"Are these color-coded to the state, or is it like the SCS where it's color-coded to NGSS?"
4191.353,4200.704,N/A,"Well, these are the cross-cutting concepts, big ideas, and science and engineering practices."
4200.724,4203.908,N/A,I think these are the redesignal.
4203.988,4205.85,N/A,"But yes, it goes with those things."
4205.89,4206.01,N/A,Right.
4209.196,4221.351,N/A,"And then these, I believe, came from the state."
4221.371,4231.024,N/A,"Yeah, because when we went through and tried to figure out what should we put in as support for, what do we feel might be missing that teachers might be like, hey, what about this?"
4231.044,4233.847,N/A,Where can we pick up those things so that people don't have to then scramble?
4233.867,4234.688,N/A,"Like, oh my god, I didn't cover whatever."
4234.708,4236.03,N/A,"So we went through each of the, well, first,"
4236.28,4250.948,N/A,And then we went back through and looked for the ones that didn't
4269.22,4275.851,N/A,She's probably taking the biology position in eighth grade.
4275.871,4276.593,N/A,They're always looking for that one.
4276.613,4287.031,N/A,"That's a big change from high school, though."
4287.051,4287.752,N/A,I think Rachel is in law school.
4297.081,4304.813,N/A,"Because we looked at the standards at first, and I was like, oh, well, these seem like"
4333.987,4341.533,N/A,We're like 23rd in the nation on education.
4367.686,4373.334,N/A,It's just what our school expects.
4373.514,4377.4,N/A,And so we're working to do that.
4377.42,4377.941,N/A,And that's the thing.
4377.961,4380.725,N/A,I think different groups are going to focus on different things.
4380.745,4386.373,N/A,And then we'll figure it out.
4386.613,4386.734,N/A,Right.
4387.014,4389.397,N/A,I don't want kids to miss out on stuff either.
4389.417,4391.561,N/A,But it is going to be what it is.
4391.581,4394.685,N/A,It is going to be a little messy and a little.
4394.805,4396.748,N/A,"And sometimes I will, when I do"
4402.027,4405.772,N/A,"And so let's think about why, what went wrong?"
4406.072,4418.91,N/A,"Why was this, you know, why did we have such difficulty getting from here to there?"
4418.93,4426.039,N/A,"And that is usually a really good discussion that they can kind of pick up on, like, oh, this was worded weird, or we weren't paying attention to whatever, or."
4426.059,4427.321,N/A,Throw themselves into it.
4427.441,4429.083,N/A,They do sometimes.
4429.123,4431.006,N/A,I have my phone now.
4431.026,4431.747,N/A,"Yeah, when you have the opportunity,"
4435.878,4449.988,N/A,It always amazes me how
4458.305,4459.667,N/A,They're self-aware.
4459.687,4460.307,N/A,OK.
4461.169,4462.891,N/A,"I feel like, yeah, I'm just going to take that zero."
4463.111,4470.32,N/A,"I had something I was talking to him about, like, OK, well, I'm going to give you this extra time, but with the understanding that you're going to use it to da, da, da."
4470.34,4478.55,N/A,"And I walk in the back, and this kid goes, I'm going to be honest with you, Ms."
4478.57,4478.71,N/A,Jacobs.
4478.73,4479.611,N/A,I'm not going to do that.
4479.631,4480.532,N/A,"I was like, I appreciate your honesty."
4480.552,4483.656,N/A,How about you plan on just coming in with a good attitude and trying your best?
4483.676,4484.698,N/A,"He goes, it'll depend on how I'm feeling."
4484.718,4485.038,N/A,"I said, OK."
4485.457,4486.498,N/A,All we can do is our best.
4486.639,4488.702,N/A,That's also going to determine your grade.
4488.722,4490.284,N/A,"Yeah, I appreciate your honesty."
4490.604,4493.268,N/A,"Oh, I think it was about the benchmark."
4493.468,4495.091,N/A,"He was like, hmm, I don't know."
4495.111,4496.953,N/A,I don't know if I can do that.
4496.973,4502.861,N/A,"I said, well, if you can't do it for yourself, do it for me."
4502.881,4503.502,N/A,"He was like, maybe."
4503.522,4505.205,N/A,I don't want to do that much.
4505.405,4507.348,N/A,"And then turns, yeah."
4507.368,4509.431,N/A,"Boy, focusing for an hour."
4509.451,4511.093,N/A,"Yeah, we talked a lot about it."
4519.358,4538.48,N/A,and these back and forth teachers.
4538.5,4539.221,N/A,We've had lots of principal changes.
4539.241,4543.506,N/A,"We finally got to a place where I was comfortable just laying out all the, I was like, listen, nobody wants to sit around feeling like they're checking boxes for somebody else to say they did this and we did this."
4543.526,4544.547,N/A,"If it's not useful, why are we spending time on it?"
4544.567,4546.309,N/A,And so we talked about the benchmark and how the data is shitty and kids aren't trying.
4546.329,4547.29,N/A,"Maybe three quarters of your honors class tries,"
4547.708,4551.357,N/A,"But there's always the kid that goes, right, exactly."
4551.417,4553.01,N/A,"Even in the honors class, they're like."
4577.105,4588.386,N/A,get an A. He finished it fine.
4588.406,4589.207,N/A,He's got the lowest grade in the school.
4589.227,4589.528,N/A,She was livid.
4589.548,4594.276,N/A,"She was like, who's gonna lose it?"
4594.297,4598.404,N/A,The kid got called into the principal's office over it.
4606.265,4621.023,N/A,I think I had one that missed two questions.
4621.043,4622.687,N/A,I usually get one 100 here.
4632.877,4634.709,N/A,The best you can get on them is a three.
4635.272,4638.634,N/A,They're expected to get a 100.
4656.417,4659.842,N/A,So there we go.
4659.862,4662.286,N/A,So there's that.
4662.386,4684.298,N/A,It just will be a year of anxiety.
4688.21,4691.133,N/A,But maybe it's helpful that we're all in it.
4691.213,4694.637,N/A,We're all going to sign it.
4694.657,4701.725,N/A,"Man, if only we had a district science coordinator for every district to help us with stuff like that."
4701.785,4702.806,N/A,"Yeah, what a time."
4707.452,4708.052,N/A,What a time.
4708.112,4712.717,N/A,"And I mean, Sherry attributed so much work on that."
4712.738,4714.92,N/A,Sherry put that whole idea.
4714.94,4717.643,N/A,"She put the whole campus groups together,"
4722.871,4731.193,N/A,It will be.
4734.127,4742.342,N/A,"Because the first thing that we had nearly a message when they told us we were all going to do this, and this is what was going to happen, and it was going to be like a workbook."
4742.703,4748.733,N/A,"We're like, OK, since you have all that now, and we don't, can you just move that into Canvas?"
4749.014,4751.398,N/A,"Because we're all, every biology teacher is going to need it."
4751.458,4753.502,N/A,So one person doing it would be so much easier.
