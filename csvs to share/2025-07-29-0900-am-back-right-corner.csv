54.166,70.764,N/A,"In terms of data, firsthand data, how would you use those?"
70.784,71.866,N/A,"Well, like we said, the place is where you are, right?"
71.886,72.748,N/A,So place-based data or place-based lessons.
98.682,123.137,N/A,Those are things we can find out.
145.342,148.045,N/A,Ooh.
268.225,271.249,N/A,using the language of probability.
651.355,664.857,N/A,I was just gonna ask what is Spell Bayesian you keep using that word over and over and over.
664.897,668.723,N/A,What is it like B IZ or B?
707.701,708.644,N/A,Okay.
708.664,709.045,N/A,Thank you.
709.166,713.018,N/A,I totally had that spelled wrong.
713.038,717.492,N/A,"Yeah, I had no idea the word you were using."
773.446,775.31,N/A,"Oh, it's so many pages."
775.33,780.341,N/A,Do I have to put my name in?
780.361,789.582,N/A,"It's so many pages, bro."
841.807,855.934,N/A,All included in her communication.
921.338,927.096,N/A,Thank you.
1001.309,1010.214,N/A,"Well, the sticky note brainstorming thing we did out in the friendship circle and then dividing up, I mean, that was all included, heard in communication."
1011.799,1015.69,N/A,And then rearranging the sticky notes and all that good stuff.
1030.469,1041.323,N/A,for themselves but also for me and we hang them on the board and we revisit them regularly and it's a lot easier for me to say like you said this is how you wanted to
1114.523,1117.328,N/A,you're still talking about the interconnectedness between.
1289.163,1290.769,N/A,"species here, right?"
1348.293,1355.94,N/A,"Yes, biodiversity is necessary."
1395.61,1406.362,N/A,"And there's lots of places where we have people go out and we're paying to remove honeysuckle, or we are going out volunteering to remove honeysuckle, right?"
1406.902,1413.65,N/A,"With our IB science juniors, we are working together with IAMS."
1414.371,1416.833,N/A,And IAMS is focusing on bird scats.
1417.134,1419.636,N/A,Is it really worth the time to remove all these invasives?
1419.797,1420.778,N/A,Is it helping the birds?
1420.798,1421.679,N/A,Is it hurting the birds?
1421.739,1422.9,N/A,What kind of biodiversity
1437.292,1438.528,N/A,They all die.
1627.287,1630.26,N/A,those to whatever standards you'd like if you want to use this exact same activity.
1654.81,1656.854,N/A,"be like, all right, who knows what this word means?"
1657.114,1658.337,N/A,"Who knows what this word means, right?"
1658.357,1660.06,N/A,Because that's the objective.
1660.08,1665.37,N/A,"So then last year, with the mindset of Project Credible, I started to put a little bit more of this on the students."
1665.39,1670.76,N/A,So more of them dissecting the objective and them modeling what they think this is going to look like.
1725.668,1725.787,N/A,Thank you.
1800.982,1803.29,N/A,Now go ahead and go to the second part.
1803.31,1806.861,N/A,Join your shoulder partner or group mates and see if you came up with similar definitions.
1807.042,1808.547,N/A,So just talk about what you wrote down.
1809.249,1812.038,N/A,"If you knew one that they didn't, then go ahead and talk to them about that."
1850.442,1854.597,N/A,"random, no plan pattern, systemic, no plan pattern."
1879.13,1893.527,N/A,right looking for the beginning letter
1899.683,1905.529,N/A,"So go ahead and flip the paper, but try not to look at the adjoining page."
1905.91,1906.931,N/A,I know that's silly.
1906.951,1911.296,N/A,"So just try and flip it and look at this one right here, where it says third, fourth, fifth."
1913.358,1914.68,N/A,Don't look at the adjoining page.
1914.7,1917.903,N/A,It's just there for the next step.
1917.923,1920.166,N/A,"So now third, fourth, fifth."
1920.646,1923.109,N/A,"And once again, we're doing this with our students."
2106.554,2109.578,N/A,Yeah.
2158.175,2161.55,N/A,to this exact same coordinate and look at this exact same spot.
2161.57,2167.054,N/A,"They could assess the biodiversity year after year and compare that to other places, right?"
2189.174,2190.517,N/A,up a little bit at the moment.
2190.878,2208.178,N/A,"So we're going to change it up just a little bit when we get outside, and we're actually going to decide what species we see the most of, and then we're going to classify those as A through B. So we all have like five species that are common, and then we're going to have"
2240.693,2243.7,N/A,"Once again, this is just stuff I show my students on Canvas."
2271.946,2272.948,N/A,at your objective again.
2273.329,2277.539,N/A,"So we are going to figure out, evaluate population abundance of non-modal species."
2278.582,2280.326,N/A,What does that mean?
2280.426,2280.647,N/A,Non-movie.
2281.027,2282.411,N/A,We are going to estimate.
2282.651,2283.273,N/A,Is it going to be perfect?
2284.636,2285.217,N/A,Heck no.
2285.237,2288.244,N/A,"We're going to do random, systematic, or transect."
2288.264,2289.347,N/A,What do y'all think if we're using hula hoop?
2301.967,2304.409,N/A,and see where it lands.
2304.429,2307.853,N/A,"So when I first started doing this, it was in January."
2307.993,2313.158,N/A,"We were outside, and we were just assessing the biodiversity of what's in the grass, really."
2313.178,2324.649,N/A,"And now we have a native garden, so we can use it a little bit more for that and stuff."
2325.109,2327.031,N/A,So yeah.
2327.091,2328.733,N/A,So you need your journal.
2342.028,2355.009,N/A,I think what we're going to do now is I left the hula hoops outside.
2355.049,2358.054,N/A,We're not using quadrants.
2358.254,2361.94,N/A,"Grab a partner, grab a hula hoop, and I'll give you further instructions."
2361.96,2366.207,N/A,We're going to kind of go wear moth and batlets.
2366.287,2368.53,N/A,And bear poop.
2368.57,2369.672,N/A,Close your eyes.
