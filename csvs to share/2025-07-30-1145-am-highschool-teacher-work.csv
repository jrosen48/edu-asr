28.162,31.666,N/A,"There's so many different, like, three."
32.987,33.427,N/A,All right.
33.447,35.87,N/A,"I see everyone's already making products, which is beautiful."
36.23,38.893,N/A,But I'm going to take you a step back and just do this mini lesson real quick.
40.014,47.502,N/A,So if everyone can go to slide 26 or 20.
47.522,50.545,N/A,20 and 21.
50.725,55.27,N/A,"So on slide 20, you see a formula."
56.05,57.612,N/A,Take a second to check out that formula.
63.413,66.036,N/A,"All right, what's big N stand for?"
67.077,67.838,N/A,Total number of individuals.
67.858,69.159,N/A,Total number of individuals.
69.199,74.725,N/A,"So if we're counting up the total number of individuals, that's not individuals of each species."
74.785,79.05,N/A,"That's the total number of individuals found all together, right?"
79.07,80.171,N/A,"All right, so what's the little n?"
81.012,82.313,N/A,Number of the species.
82.334,83.355,N/A,Number of the species.
83.435,84.796,N/A,"OK, what's this fancy letter?"
84.856,86.999,N/A,Epsilon.
88.0,89.181,N/A,"Oh, I don't call it epsilon."
89.461,89.782,N/A,Oops.
89.822,91.003,N/A,Am I wrong?
91.023,91.904,N/A,I thought that was an epsilon.
91.924,92.224,N/A,Sigma?
92.464,92.965,N/A,Sigma.
93.299,93.659,N/A,Maybe.
93.679,93.88,N/A,OK.
94.08,94.24,N/A,OK.
95.962,98.286,N/A,"So it's like capital sigma, right?"
99.067,100.829,N/A,In summation is all I got.
100.849,100.969,N/A,Yes.
100.989,101.109,N/A,OK.
101.209,102.451,N/A,So I'm going to sum it.
102.491,102.751,N/A,Sum up.
102.791,103.372,N/A,Who cares?
103.592,104.053,N/A,OK.
104.133,107.918,N/A,"And then, so sum of, so n and then n minus 1."
107.958,110.882,N/A,So we would do each species sum of one at a time.
110.902,111.062,N/A,OK?
111.323,112.304,N/A,So now go to slide 21.
112.424,116.269,N/A,And someone in that.
117.278,121.442,N/A,"Tell me, we have two different ecosystems here, okay?"
122.262,126.466,N/A,"Just at first glance, which ecosystem do you think is more biodiverse, left or right?"
128.668,130.87,N/A,Depends on what type of biodiversity you're talking about.
131.07,131.47,N/A,Beautiful.
134.113,135.994,N/A,"So, kind of depends, right?"
137.215,141.059,N/A,So we got ecosystem A on the left and ecosystem B on the right.
144.482,145.783,N/A,You looking for a hand raise?
146.0,149.524,N/A,"I'm just looking for who thinks ecosystem, yeah, good call."
149.544,151.287,N/A,Who thinks ecosystem A is more biodiverse?
152.268,153.209,N/A,Has more species.
153.83,154.571,N/A,"Okay, has more species."
154.591,156.193,N/A,Who thinks ecosystem B is more biodiverse?
157.074,158.696,N/A,B is more sustainable.
159.016,160.178,N/A,"Okay, how come?"
160.238,161.299,N/A,Because it's evenness.
161.66,162.761,N/A,"Okay, so for evenness."
162.781,164.183,N/A,"So we can go back to evenness and richness, right?"
165.044,167.367,N/A,So if we were to do out the math here.
